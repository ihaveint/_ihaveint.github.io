Nice seeing you here :)

I'm Soroush. You can call me J these days.
This page has seen a bunch of revisions in the past and might still do, but I've concluded that I can't write a good 'about me' page! I don't want it to be about the things I do. I want it to be about who I am. And that's hard to talk about! But the essence of who I am is someone who believes in mental and physical toughness in any possible pursuit. I don't hold others to my own standards, but I do judge them in the sense of whether I should be friends with them or not since any kind of friendship will also affect me and whatever I'm trying to do :)) So yeah, I do judge, but for my own sake. I don't care what you do with your own life!

Other than the philosophical aspect, I'm an overall funny guy (I've been told). I sometimes code, draw if I really need some wholly peace, gym frequently, and learn random things. As of now, it's the Korean language. I listen to an ungodly amount of music (not really the mainstream ones, though), and I am that guy who does what he thinks he should do, regardless of the consequences.


This website is like my blog, where I write things I have on my mind.

I'm also active on some other platforms:
* Telegram: [ihaveint](https://t.me/ihaveint)
* Linkedin: [Soroush Zare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihaveint/)

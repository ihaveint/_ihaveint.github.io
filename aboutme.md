Welcome! I'm Soroush, and this is daily Z. if you want to know the origin of daily Z, it's just some random thing that Gary Vaynerchuk mentioned one day. That's pretty much it :))

I'm a CS guy (20 years old at the time of writing this), who is also interested in art. The goal of this journey is to become an artist who is interested in CS, but we'll have to figure out what kind of art that is;)

The most random fact about me

title: About me
---

Hi! I'm Soroush; I am a (alumni) computer science student at Sharif university of technology.

I consider myself an engineer, in the sense that I try to solve my day to day problems using engineering. I guess that can also be considered a form of art that I try to master everyday! I also work as a software engineer at [DigiExpress](https://www.digiexpress.ir).

This website is sort of like my blog, where I write things that I have on my mind. 

I'm also active on some other platforms:
* Recently I started a personal podcast, where I share pieces of my day that I think might be valuable to others. It's called 'Just a normal Day' and you can find it on places like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1Mp8lyk7bc9GXEpWxhQ6xE) and [Castbox](https://castbox.fm/vc/5036294). It's in Persian, so don't worry if you're not comfortable listening to an English podcast! :)
* Telegram: [ihaveint](https://t.me/ihaveint)
* Linkedin: [Soroush Zare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soroush-z-a1180611b/)
* Twitter: @ihaveint; note that I'm not active in the sense of twitting, but I will be glad to follow a friend or two! So, if you are on twitter, feel tree to send me a message there :)
* Youtube: I have an [English channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UC7KYSjerybezxG1sDHZty6A), and a [Persian One](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwU7CpdMntr-X7Fsc4MpPMQ). I'm not super active on Youtube since I need to take some time to learn editing, and also get a better camera :)) But it's on my to-do list to get back on Youtube soon!

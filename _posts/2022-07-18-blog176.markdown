A strange day,

Today (or yesterday, depending on how you look at it), was a strange day. I've been recovering from COVID, but it seems like I have lost some parts of my personality. And dealing with this is troublesome for me. While I have enough energy to act as if nothing has changed, I know deep inside that some things are not yet in place. I know that I will get them back, for the most part, but I wonder if I don't :) In that case, I have to rely on other parts of my personality that I still have with me :) And that's sad to some extent, saying goodbye to some parts of you; but what can I do? :)) I'm not the type to whine about these things! So I'm going to deal with it.

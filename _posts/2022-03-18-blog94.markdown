Optimizing for what?

I think I've talked about this before, but I'm in the same space of thought, so I wanted to talk about it again.
A lot of us have been raised to optimize things in our lives. It could be money, success, knowledge, etc. Something that most people don't seem to realize is that to maximize something, you often have to take a step back (decrease it first) to be able to take two steps forward later. You can't ALWAYS increase everything! At some point, or else you'll find yourself stuck in a local maximum instead of a global maximum. Now, I'm not saying that you should aim for the global maximum! I'm just saying that you shouldn't look only one step ahead; you kind of need to be a chess master when you are planning your life :)

Decisions,

It's hard to make decisions; at least for me! This turns into a nightmare especially when I'm deciding between multiple things to do, and all of them have their unique benefits. But I can't possibly do all of them! in an ideal world, I would simply pick one of them and get done with it. But in reality, I might be in a state of chaos, not being able to decide, for a very long time.

One thing that I'm trying to mitigate this, is making decisions that are invertible to a greater extent! Committing to something that takes months, or even years, to finish is something that I try to avoid unless it screams at me that I should do it! Pursuing a Ph.D. is one of those things for me (and one of the only things, to be honest!)

In other words, this is equivalent to not making any commitment that you don't feel is necessary. It is kind of selfish at times, and people might get annoyed at you! But hey, I'm trying my best over here :))

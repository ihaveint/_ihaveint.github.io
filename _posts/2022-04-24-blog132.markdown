Power of writing,

It's becoming more evident to me that writing well is powerful. I knew it was powerful before, but I didn't realize how much power it is. And the amazing thing is that when you can write well, you can do other things better as well :) I think it's mostly because writing is a medium for thinking, and when you can write well, it means you can express your thoughts better. And if you can express your thoughts better, you literally understand yourself better :) It's such an amazing thing.

Three kinds of people,

I'm a firm believer that there are two kinds of people in this world. Those who win, and those who lose! Winning and Losing is not necessarily something that has to be defined by society, but everyone knows in their gut when they are losing, or winning. Winning can sometimes be a small act, as small as getting out of bed when you don't feel like it. But sometimes, it can be much bigger than that. The same goes for losing. The important thing is that you have to define these things for yourself! But whatever you do, you are either losing or winning! There is no middle ground here :)


I remember reading a sentence somewhere (probably from Mark Manson somewhere), which was along these lines:
There is no such thing as a morning person; There is, however, a person who just wakes up in the morning.

So, as you can imagine, I'm still looking for the third type of person :)

Music,

I love music. It's like an old friend that I don't need to talk to, but still brings tons of memories every time I sit next to it. Hell! I don't even know if I can do the same with a friend without talking to them. There are all kinds of music, and I love to think about what the artist wanted to convey when coming up with the music.

Another amazing thing about music is that it can change my mood significantly. It's an obvious conclusion, but I'm amazed about how much people ignore this simple fact :) You can't expect to listen to depressing songs, and magically be happy at the end of the day.

Being unique,

People sometimes take 'being unique' the wrong way. Being unique is not always good: being uniquely dumb is not going to help you achieve anything in life. But being uniquely humorous might help you! And this applies to a lot of things: overall, you shouldn't be unique just for the sake of it. You should be unique in a way that helps you. And all the things that you are unique at should accumulate into something amazing, not a mess :)

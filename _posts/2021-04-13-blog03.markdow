That was unexpected! 

Sometimes you get what you want, just by asking.
I used to think this is bad, I told my self "then what about hardwork?".
The thing is, regardless of how hard you work, if that's all you do, 
you probably won't get what you want. most of our goals require recognition of our hard work
to some extent, that's why it's crucial to put your work in the best position to be recognized.

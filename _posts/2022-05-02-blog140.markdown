Assumptions,

There is an assumption (or many) in our decisions that we often don't think about validating. Usually, it's not harmful to assume things: the worst that can happen is that you realize your decision was wrong, and you will choose another path. But sometimes, an assumption can cost you a lot, more than you can begin to imagine. So I think it's a good practice to know your assumptions, before taking any action and coming up with ways that can test your them fast, without taking big losses in the future.

One simple way to figure out your assumptions, is to ask "why?" continuously until you reach an atomic belief that might seem so trivial to you, but still need to be validated if you want to avoid a bigger loss in the end.

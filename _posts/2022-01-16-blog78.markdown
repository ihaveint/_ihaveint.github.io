This was unexpected,

I messed up something yesterday. Like, something that I would've never thought I can even mess up.
So, right now, I'm in a state of disbelief, thinking about how I can fix this. There is like a 5 percent chance that I can't fix this, and that would be very unfortunate :)
I'm not going to talk in details about this, but the moral of the story is: do what you can, while you can do it. Don't put things off just because you think you are capable of doing it later!

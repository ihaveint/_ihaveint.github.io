I'm lecturing a series about functional programming, with focus on fault tolerance and distributed systems, the first session what today.

So most of my time today was spent on that. We had a test lecture prior to that. There are certainly benefits to doing this, but one of them is that I get to understand things better when I try to teach them and also when I'm researching for things to say, I learn so much more.

But putting all those beside, the reason I'm doing this was something completely different, I'm not going to talk about that now :)

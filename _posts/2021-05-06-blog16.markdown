The panda is awake,

Well, I had an exam today, didn't go well :(
It was one of those exams in the form of standardized tests, which I have a bad reputation on - _ -

Other than that, I refactored the [MapReduce](https://github.com/ihaveint/map_reduce) project further, I also have some ideas for new projects,
one was to implement a simple web framework, and another was to implement a simple online judge backend from scratch (I previously forked [DMOJ](https://github.com/DMOJ/judge-server) and made an online judge,
  but I thought it would be cool if I can make a judge backend by my own, so I started coding that too)

Learn, Unlearn, relearn. Again, and again, and again!

I've been thinking about this issue lately: What makes some people excel at each new job they go into, regardless of how different it is compared to their experience. One conclusion so far is that they can unlearn the things that they already know, combine it with learning new things, and sometimes relearn the things that they have unlearned :) Do these things enough times, and they become good at their new job, sooner than you might even imagine!

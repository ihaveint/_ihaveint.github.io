How I'm realizing that I'm scared of a bunch of things ...

I have been talking about some things with one of my housemates every now and then, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm probably scared.
The things that we talked about are mostly about how some areas of my life "used to" look like, and how they are not like that at all anymore, and me wanting to go back to the old state I was in. Now, the reason why I think I'm scared, is that we've been mostly talking about how I could try and at least get close, even a little bit, to what things used to look like, and why I'm not actually making progress towards it. Today, it occured to me that I'm probably scared; scared of what might happen if I give it my all, and it still doesn't work. What if it never looks like what I want it to? And this realization is actually scary as shit :) I'm realizing how 'perfect' it was, and how rare it is to have a period of your life that you think is perfect. I am grateful that I've had such a period, but I'm scared that I might never have it again. It's like living in heaven for a life, and then getting kicked out of it! You don't even need to go to hell, but compared to heaven, everything is hell, as far as you're concerned!

So right now, I'm at the crossroad. What should I do? I'm still thinking about it; I don't have any answers :))

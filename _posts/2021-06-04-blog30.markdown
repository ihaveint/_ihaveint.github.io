Today I participated in a competitive programming contest, it's been quite a while since I did that :))

One thing that was really interesting to me was that even after all these years I can code quite fast because of something belived to be `muscle memory`. Another fun thing was that I solved most of the questions using recursion, which is kind of rare for me.

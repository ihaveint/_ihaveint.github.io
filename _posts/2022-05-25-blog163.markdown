Not knowing,

Something interesting that I find myself doing sometimes is trying to determine the exact amount of effort I need to put into something to get the result I want. Most of the time, that thing requires so much more devotion than I first anticipated! But in a weird sense, I think that's a good thing! That's because a lot of times, things require sou much more effort than you might think at first. And if you knew that, you wouldn't even dare to start. But when you take your first step, and the second one after that, you find yourself interested in finishing that thing, and you have a higher chance of doing it, even though it requires more effort than you anticipated. Of course, it's not always like that; sometimes things are much easier than you think. But interestingly, even in that case, your best bet is to just start instead of worrying about the exact amount of effort it will take!

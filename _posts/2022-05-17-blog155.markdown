Staying sane,

It's interesting that two people can do the same thing, where one of them can only do it short term, and the other can do it for longer. It might have to do with lots of factors: Some of them might even be physical. But you got to give the 'mindset behind the work' a credit! Just doing the same thing doesn't mean that these two people can stay sane for the same period of time, especially if it's a difficult task to do! You have to go deeper than that, before predicting how long they will do it. The reason why they are doing it, they price they have already paid for it, the price they are willing to pay, and so many other thing!

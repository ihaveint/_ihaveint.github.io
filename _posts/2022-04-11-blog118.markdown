Just an accident?

After posting the last blog and going to Spotify to listen to some music, I saw that the name of the song I was listening to before was 'Jenga'. Usually, I call that an accident (that the whole analogy of the last blog was around Jenga). But sometimes I wonder if these things are related: That somewhere in the back of my mind, I was thinking about Jenga, and I used it in a blog while I wasn't even aware of the fact that it was on the back of my mind. Being an accident or not doesn't seem important in this case, but it can be useful in other scenarios. One level of usefulness would be able to tap into our subconscious and realize things that otherwise are impossible to understand. The simpler thing that can be used immediately, is just using the fact that what we spend our time on is going to affect every other area of our life as well. Even the music you listen to might change what you write about and how you think about things. So being a little more intentional about things we do, even our hobbies, might make a huge difference in our lives over the long term.

Automation,

I think I underestimated the power of automation! I'm talking about the kind powered by software: There are so many things in our daily live hoods that can be done automatically so that we can focus on what's important, yet we don't use this power enough. There are many advancements in technology that makes it easier to use automation, but we are becoming a victim of these new advancements, not being able to truly take advantage of them. To be fair, I can't speak for everybody, so let's just say that I'm someone who needs to take advantage of automation more :) So, I'm thinking about learning more about automation and developing some skills on it that might benefit me over time.

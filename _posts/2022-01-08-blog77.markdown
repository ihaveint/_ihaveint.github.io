"You get energy out of people like that",

A lot of somehow managed to convince ourselves that we don't care about other people: What they think, how they act, etc. But the reality is, for most of us, that not the case! Like, it's almost impossible not to get effected by others, in any area :) What really happens, is that we get so bothered by the effect of others, that we lie to ourselves, to the point that we even forget that it's a lie, that we don't care about others and we don't get effected by them.

So, in conclusion, hang around people that inspire you. Don't hang out with people who are negative all the time.

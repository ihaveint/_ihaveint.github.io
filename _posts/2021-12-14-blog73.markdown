Compilers, deadlines, and taking a break

Seeing that I wrote the last blog 4 days ago is weird; I thought it would be way longer than that! In a sense, these current days are taking too long to pass. But here are some updates:

I just finished [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com).
It was just amazing. For close to 200 hundred pages of book, it did an amazing job on what goes in writing an interpreter. But there was a catch at the end: [The lost chapter](https://interpreterbook.com/lost/) of the book covered how to implement a macro system: It was fascinating! I'm going to continue the series by reading [Writing a compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com) next.

On the side, I'm also reading [Sicp](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) now, this time for good (front to back). This was a huge decision for me, since the book is somewhat lengthy. But the decision was finalized when I realized that I just love the way the book is written, and I can just read it to enjoy the little time I have as a human being to live :) The concepts are also beautiful, so I would learn a lot of stuff as well, but that's honestly not the goal for this book.

There are a lot of other things that I would like to talk about, but I have a deadline to catch! So I guess I would leave the rest for later.

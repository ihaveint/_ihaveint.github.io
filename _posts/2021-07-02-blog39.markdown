I always thought it's easy to do the right thing,

Well, at least till I encountered an opportunity that I desperately needed, but turns out it involved something that I thought was not a good thing to do. It was SO hard for be to convince my self that I shouldn't do it (In fact I almost did the reverse). Part of it because I was desperate for the opportunity, and I had (and still have) no idea how I'm going to find a similar one. It kind of hurts, but at the end of the day, thinking that I did what seemed right `to me`, gives me hope.

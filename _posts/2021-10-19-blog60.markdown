Everything is perfect, until it's not

I've been struggling to write this one; But that's exactly the thing! The past few blogs were easy to write; Everything was 'perfect'! But now it's not, and that's OK. We shouldn't
expect everything to function the same as time goes on. Everything will, and should, change. It would be weird not to!

OK, it's like another day that I'm trying to finish this blog. And "Bad" things keep happening. At this point, all I can do it give my all and hope the best. Let's finish this blog :))

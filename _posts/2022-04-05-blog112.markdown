Dealing with (physical) pain,

First, a disclaimer: I haven't dealt with extreme pain that some people might have to fight with, some even for their entire lives. This might not apply to those kinds of pain, and I'm just speaking about my own experience :)

I have a proposition for dealing with pain: First, try to mitigate it on the physical level, which might mean taking medicines or whatever your doctor told you to do. But after a point, focusing on the pain is only going to make things worse. But of course, it's not easy to deviate from the pain and do other things; so what I suggest is having some responsibilities for things that you NEED to do; having things that you need to do, regardless of the pain you're dealing with, makes you focus on something else besides the pain, and it can help so much sometimes. This might not always be possible, and I'm not telling you that you need to work even if you feel like you're going to die from the pain (I'm not that kind of person!). I'm just saying, as much as you can, find something else that enables you to concentrate on something else than your misery.

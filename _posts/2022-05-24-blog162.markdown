More similar to robots than we think,

We humans like to think that we are free in some sense: We are free to do whatever we want at each moment of our day. But I don't think that's the case: It seems like we are like robots: We do things according to how we have been programmed to. The one difference, and a critical one, between we and robots is that we are the ones who program ourselves, in the forms of habits (while robos can't program themselves)! The amount of things we do out of habit each day are far more than the amount of things we do consciously.

All of what I said seems like common sense to a lot of us. But I just thought it would be nice to write them as a reminder. One thing that I never really thought about is that "the thinking" itself is a habit. Our thinking might be destructive, a process that never really helps us, or constructive and helpful. When we are thinking, we are actually just thinking as we 'always' do, which is nothing but a habit.

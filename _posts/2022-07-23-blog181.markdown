Unexpected,

Sometimes, we put so much effort into something and it simply doesn't work. It might be even worth than that: It burns and crashes, after finally getting to a state of being beautiful :) And there are other times when you casually do something, and it works perfectly! 

And people have different opinions on this! Some people don't even agree that this phenomenon exists! Some people agree that it exists, but think that it's cruel. Others, like me, believe that it's lovely that the world is like this :))

The reason I think this way is that nothing is that beautiful until you put some randomness into it :) And the randomness of something not working, no matter how much effort you put into it, is beautiful in my eyes! Of course, we can decrease the randomness the more expert we become in something, but I don't think we can ever make it deterministic (not random).

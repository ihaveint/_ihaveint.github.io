It's been a while :)

The past year has been a bit different: I usually play on the offensive side :) Not physically, but in that I don't react to things and do what I want instead. But I've been playing on the defensive (reactive) side for some reason. And I wouldn't say I like that. It's not me :)

So, I've been starting to change things for a while. I want to talk about something other than the specifics at this point. But I will say that I'm making some VERY deliberate changes. Nothing is just for change itself. Everything is an experiment with a goal in mind. And the goal is VERY clear. More than ever. And it's still a work in progress to make it more clear.

I called this blog "Playing". I say playing because life is a playground. The difference between life and video games is that you decide the boss you want to face. And if you f*ck up, you might die with no second chance. And it makes it much more enjoyable than video games if you're just about crazy enough :)

There are for sure other differences, too. I'm figuring things out myself as I play more.

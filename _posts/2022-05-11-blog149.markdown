Weird as hell,

I'm not a person who looks back on life and try to figure out if the things that happened were good or bad. But sometimes, I can't help but feel surprised that some of the things that I was convinced were bad/good ended up not being so bad/good in the end. I think it's human nature to judge the past, but we can overcome the instinct to do it all the time. But looking back from time to time, to confirm that you should not judge the events so much is a fun practice :)

Hi, 

Today I'm going to spend most of my time reading some text books on
combinatorial optimization and computer networks.

I haven't practiced Japanee for a couple of days, which makes me sad.

I'm also trying to use vim more effectively, I highly recommend this 
[lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/), but also all the other lectures of this course as well!

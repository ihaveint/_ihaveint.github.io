On 21th of September, the government disconnected the internet in Tehran. The last time that this happened was about 3 years ago.
I remember how frustrating it was at the time, to see how easy it is for a government to ruin every aspect of my life.

This time, however, it hit me different! I feel as if no matter what's going to happen after this, I should still take responsibility for my own life. I can't change how the government acts, what country I was born in, a bunch of other shit, but there are still things that I can do, at least till I'm alive :)

Of course, I'm angry about what's happening, and I'm not denying it. But here, I'm talking about what I'm going to do with this anger. I think it makes me even more determined to take responsibility for my own life, ironically!

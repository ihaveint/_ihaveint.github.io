Beautiful Love,

I think that 'love' can take different shapes: Sometimes, it becomes like a flower. Other times, it becomes a wall that you can rely on. Other times, it might even hurt you, but in a way that you become dependent on the pain.

But the question is, why would all of us search for love, when it can take all these different shapes? Shouldn't we search for exactly what we want at each moment in time?

For me, love should always be beautiful :) If it's not, I don't want it! It could be extremely valuable, but I wouldn't call it love :) I guess that's the extent to which I'm willing to follow 'art' in my life. There's nothing I like more than 'art'. I follow art in programming, in love, in my personal space, and every other area of my life.

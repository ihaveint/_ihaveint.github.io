Gamification,

I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0) today, which was really interesting.
I always had this idea on the back of my mind, but by watching it explained with this much detail really illuminated it's importance. Basically the idea is that our mind works much better, and gives up much later if we try to look at everything from a game point of view. Besides that, it will be more fun, a win-win situation :)

Full-Screen,

It's amazing how we are trained to do multiple things at once. But as you might already know, there are countless facts that shows we are not good at doing multiple things at once. In fact, we can't even do it! What actually happens is that we context-switch between different tasks, and it is detrimental to our productivity on each individual task. You might feel like you are doing more and are more productive, but you are not!

There is one particular thing that I wanted to bring to your attention with this introduction: We all need a time to work, and a time to relax. Always remember to separate the two as clear as you can. And when you are doing each of the two, try to solely focus on it, and nothing more!

Note on the beginning of the blog ('Full-Screen'): I noticed that I love watching movies to relax! But something that happens constantly is that instead of entering full-screen mode and just focusing on the movie, I end up watching it while getting distracted with everything in the way. And a lot of times, it kills the mood entirely! So, this was a reminder to myself that whatever you are doing in each particular moment of your life, you should do it in full-screen mode! :)

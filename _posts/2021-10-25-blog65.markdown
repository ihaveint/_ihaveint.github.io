Toward the end, yo go faster, not slower

My birthday is on 20th of April. I realized a couple of weeks a go that my next year would probably be a unique one. It doesn't matter what happens exactly, it's just going to be a especial moment. Especially since a lot of things that started earlier, some about 4 years ago and some even more than a decade, are going to end. I don't really know how to feel about that! I just know that this couple of remaining months are going to be my only chance to wrap things up as neat as I can; I'm going to do my best!

And my keyboard is broke, AGAIN!

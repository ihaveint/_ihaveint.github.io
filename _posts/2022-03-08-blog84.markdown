On trauma,

If you were to ask me, I would say that I've never had something traumatizing happening to me. Recently, I've been wondering if that's true!
You see, I did a lot of what I would call 'bold' moves during my childhood. While at the time these actions seemed normal to me, I noticed that I keep having dreams about them, long after they no longer have consequences in my life. I wouldn't be lying to say I'm having dreams about these things every other day, if not every day! And in those dreams, everything seems so much like it used to be in real life, except that it's so much scarier than I remember it to be! And every time I wake up from one of these dreams, I just smile that it wasn't real. 

What I'm trying to show by all this, is not that I'm a victim or that you should be sorry for me. What I'm trying to say is that sometimes you might have experiences in your life that are hard on your psyche, and you might not realize it at the time! But whenever you do, don't try to run away from it; just accept that these things had effects on your life, probably more than you anticipated, and come to terms with it, as much as you possibly can!

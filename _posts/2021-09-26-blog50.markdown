Before you can analyze,

Sometimes, it not most of the times, it is truly beneficial to do something before you can analyze whether it's a good thing or not.

Let's say you want to know if Professor 'X' would say yes if you asked something from them. Well, why don't you just email them and see what would happen? Instead of asking every one of your friends to see if they had a similar experience.

This is something that I see everyday; I think we should differentiate between times when you should do something carefully, and other occasions where it would be better, in every aspect, to just do the damn thing instead of thinking about it.

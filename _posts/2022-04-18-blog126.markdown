Here we go again,

Sometimes you try to avoid something, but you find yourself encountering it, over and over again. There's a saying that "you meet your destiny on the road you take to avoid it". I'm not the kind of person who thinks our destiny is set in stone, and we don't have any control over it. But sometimes, I wonder if that's true! Sometimes I feel baffled by how much I tried to avoid something, but just couldn't.
I'm thinking if there is any solution to this. Should we lose hope and surrender? I don't think so! Even if you are faced with an enemy that you know is going to defeat you, I think you should still fight to the best of your ability. Who knows what's going to happen at the end.

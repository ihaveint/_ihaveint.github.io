Yesterday I spent most of my time doing the map reduce project with elixir, so far seems good :))


I really enjoy working with elixir, I probably have a long way to reach a idiomatic way of writing elixir,
  but I'm looking forward to it.

Apart from that, I think I lack in some really important aspects of programming, I don't know the exact problem but
I can really feel it sometimes, So that's something I'm constantly thinking about.

So mad,

This is a personal note I made for myself to remember in the future, not for people to understand; sorry!

It probably has been more than six years. Maybe even more than that! I can only vaguely remember how it used to be. And right now, this is probably what 'regret' looks like. Looking back, this is the only thing in life that I regret so far; and not only that, it hurts so much that I don't know what to do with it. 

And now, after all these years of wondering why, I know why.

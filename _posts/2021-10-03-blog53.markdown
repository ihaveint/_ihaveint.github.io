Just ask (well, not always)!

The idea is simple!
There are so many times that we want something in life, and the only way to do it is by finding someone who is willing to help us, to some capacity.
In such occasions, we might get paralyzed. "Who should I ask?". This is a question I have asked myself to many times. But recently, I'm trying to not ask myself this question and just ask every person that can possibly help. At first, I felt really bad about it. "Why would they help me?", I asked. But something strange happened! A lot of people who I never thought would help, actually said yes. This is seriously life changing, the lesson, for me, whas this:
"Why they should help, is not my business. All I can do is ask, to see if they might help".
And don't get me wrong, not everybody is going to say yes. They might even be people who say no, even people who you were absolutely sure were going to say yes. That's just life, don't judge it.

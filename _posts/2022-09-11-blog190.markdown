Today started as a normal day. I did almost everything that I wanted to do, so it was quite good in that respect. What I didn't plan to happen, was having a bad headache :) But I guess that happens sometimes! Some unexpected things happened as well! I got to talk to someone who I see a couple of times every week. I never thought that I would talk to them; the world is such a small place :)

Also, after about 3 months of not watching any movies, I got to watch an episode of a KDrama! Hooray :D

I also talked to some of the people in our company about different parts of our business; it was something that I didn't do until now, and I don't even know why :) I guess I become bolder as I move through life: these days, I'm not scared to talk to people about things that concern me anymore.

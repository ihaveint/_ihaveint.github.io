Muscle memory,

I'm fascinated by the concept of muscle memory. It's one of those things that can take years to build for each skill that you have in mind but can pay off for the rest of your life. It's hard to believe, in the midst of doing something hard, that you are going to be able to do this EASILY a couple of years from now, but it will happen eventually, and it will feel amazing!

Now I'm thinking to myself: If I'm going to do this one more time, for a new thing this time, what would it be? What do I want to be able to do with ease, a couple of years down the road? I have no idea. It's something that I need more time to figure out.

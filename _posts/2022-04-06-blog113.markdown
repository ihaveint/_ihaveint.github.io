Give it some time,

I think an obstacle that often makes us give up is that we put so much time into something and yet we find ourselves as clueless as we were at the beginning. We might say to ourselves "Surely, I don't have talented enough" or "I'm not built for this". While these claims might be true, I think an undervalued factor is not the number of hours we have spent on something but the duration of time that we let grow by itself on our minds. You won't believe how important this is till you experience it with something: some topics are not meant to be read and immediately understood by heart! A lot of them are meant to be absorbed over time. And no matter what you do, unless you are some kind of genius in a topic or have some prerequisite that allows you to learn it faster, you have to wait for it to shape in your mind :) It doesn't mean that you don't have to practice it, but be patient with it :)) At some point, you will probably understand more. 

But hey, you might as well not be suited for a subject, but I still think you shouldn't decide this early with the first obstacle :)

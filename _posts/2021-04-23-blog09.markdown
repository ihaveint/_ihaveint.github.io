Feeling lazy,

This past few weeks I've been feeling unmotivated to do things. It might have something to do with quarantine but I can't really 
do anything about that :)

The only solution that comes to mind is just start doing things, but slowly.
So for starters, I plan on learning rust (to follow the tcp implementation on Jon's tutorials, mentionned in the last blog)
and also start implementing the project for my distributed systems course. I plan on setting a specific time in my calender each day for thiese activities
to make them easier to stick. I set 1 hour for each of them for now.

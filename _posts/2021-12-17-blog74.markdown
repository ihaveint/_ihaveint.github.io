Changing ways,

I've had this habit for a long time, that I try my hardest to not read books that are not aesthetically beautiful!
I don't know, I just had the feeling that the beauty aspect of the book gives me courage to finish it. At least for me, it has always been a great factor in reading books.
But over the years, there have been many books that I came across, that didn't meet the prescription but were still great books. I told to myself that I didn't need to read them, that there were other great books that I could read instead. But now, I think that's just causing me to miss out :) So starting today, whenever I see a book that's not as aesthetically pleasing as I would like it to be, I might as well read some pages and then decide what to do with it :)

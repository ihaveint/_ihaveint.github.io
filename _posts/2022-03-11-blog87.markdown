Consuming versus producing ...

You have probably heard this advice, that "you should be a producer instead of being a consumer". To some extent, it's obvious where this advice comes from. The whole notion of trying to produce things instead of just consuming them seems good when you think about it. You would probably have a bigger impact, and you can also try to change the world, if that's something you're into :) But sometimes I wonder if this is good advice, and what do we even mean by being a "consumer". Let's say someone reads a lot of book, does that count as consuming? And if so, what's wrong with consuming a lot of books? I can see that if you only read books and do nothing with the knowledge you gain, you are doing something wrong! But what if you consume & produce a lot, at the same time? What's wrong with that? I'm not really sure! I don't think it's something binary that's either bad or good; I think it's relative to what you're trying to achieve at the moment!

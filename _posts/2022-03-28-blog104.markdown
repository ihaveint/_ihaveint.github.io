Good things might come to those who wait, but not to those who wait too late,

It seems to me that there is a nice dance between patience and speed. You have to execute fast on a micro-basis level, but be patient in the long term. This is something that I learned from GaryVee to some extent, but I have internalized it more over the years, and I truly live by it. 

By executing fast and fiercely, you know that you gave everything you got. But that's not enough! Sometimes you need to wait for your plans to pay off. And that's where patience comes into play.

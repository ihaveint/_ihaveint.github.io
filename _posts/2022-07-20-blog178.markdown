Becoming aggressive,

I had a conversation last night, that made me shift back a little bit into my mood before I got COVID. And that's both good and bad at the same time!

It's bad, since I was using these couple of days to rest; you know, almost like a vacation, as crazy as it sounds! It was good because I got back something that I lost with COVID: being aggressive while staying calm.

So, for the next couple of weeks, I'm going to become a bit aggressive since I have an undone business, waiting to be done :))

Overall, I can see that the next couple of days (especially the weekend) are going to be harsh. But I guess that's life :)) But it can continue well into the next month or so.

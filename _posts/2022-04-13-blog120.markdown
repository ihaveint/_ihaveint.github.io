Almost (certainly) to a fault,

Some things can be counted as good, but can also become extremely dangerous when taken to an extreme. Take someone who tries to do everything as fast (but efficient) as possible. This habit can lead to a lot of good things in someone's life, but it can be extremely dangerous when applied to things that can backfire if not executed according to plan. I think it's important to behave differently when we are dealing with different tasks of different importance. But doing that is hard on another level since a lot of us do things according to habit, which is mostly unconscious.

But the overall point of this writing is to remind us that we all have habits that are considered good but can be detrimental after a certain point. We should always be careful about these habits, and try not to rely on them too much.

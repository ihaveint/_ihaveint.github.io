A blank day,

I don't have anything, in particular, to say for today :))
I had to do some vaccinations, and I was feeling pretty bad the whole day. So it was kind of like a rest day with an excuse. But to put a philosophical twist to it, as I always do(!), I wonder how this works for the people who have to do this kind of thing frequently their whole lives, like people who have illnesses that require this sort of thing. I deeply respect how strong they are!

Useless discussions,

I'm one of those people that absolutely love discussing things, and talking in general. But sometimes it backfires when I choose the wrong person for the topic: I just can't find the right person for it, and can't keep myself from discussing it with people that are already available! At the end, the other party is usually sad about the whole conversation, while I'm a bit upset that their didn't see my intent of purely discussing things! Reasons like this make me excited to expand my network of people over the years, to allow me to discuss each topic with the right person :)

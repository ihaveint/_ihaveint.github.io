On Criticize,

I think it's so easy to criticize others without realizing the amount of work that it might take to do what we expect them to do. When you need to do the same thing, you understand how hard it is. So, as Jordan Peterson puts it, we should try to clean our own room before we criticize how bad the state of the world is and how it should be instead.

On the other hand, I think people in power should be criticized! When you have power, it's not just about you anymore, and people will hold you to a standard. This also applies when someone gets higher positions in their career: each time you get a higher position, you should except yourself to do a better job, and other people should also have a higher expectation from you.

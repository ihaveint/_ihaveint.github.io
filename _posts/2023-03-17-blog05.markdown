I always say: "Everything is great, until it's not". But the reverse is also true ...

Sometimes (not often, but every now and then), I find myself in a crisis; one of those that I don't even have an ounce of hope to get out of. But fortunately, I've seen so many times that it's not true! You almost can get out of anything, unless it's a terminal illness or something. And that's what I was doing the past couple of weeks :)) Everything was completely fu*ked! And all I did, was just going through it, without trying to make it worse. Slowly, I tried doing little things to improve the situation, and not complaining and making excuses! And here I am, a few weeks later, in an incredibly state of mind; even better than where I was before the whole 'crisis' :))

And with every crisis, you learn a whole bunch of things out of it, which makes me grateful :)) For me, it taught me that I shouldn't care about 'what I feel' I should do at each point of my life, and instead do what I 'should' do instead. 'Feelings' don't work as I used to think. Sometimes you think they are protecting you, while all they are doing is stopping you from doing what actually matters.

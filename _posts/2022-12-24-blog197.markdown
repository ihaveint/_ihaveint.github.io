I remember being a kid, and spending a lot of my time doing things that I was actually good at :)) Over time, as I grew, I kind of drifted apart into other directions. I still would like to believe that I'm good at things that I do, but there are just different things, and I'm not even sure if I'm as good as I used to be, in other realms of life :))

So, with that being said, I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing things that I used to do :)) I don't like discussing it early on, but I would share more as I get more into it and they become a part of my routine.

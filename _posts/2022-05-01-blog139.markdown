The problem with dreams,

(First, note that I'm talking about literal dreams when we sleep, not the other kind of dreams!)

I have a personal problem with dreams: I'm sometimes unable to distinguish between facts that emerged from a dream and facts from real life! I dream a lot, more than I want to actually. When I sleep, a lot of my dreams are ridiculously similar to what happens in real life! As a result, there are some small things on my mind, that I'm not sure if they happened in a dream, or real life. For example, I had an assignment due yesterday, and I'm not sure if I saw a typo in it in real life, or a dream! This is something that can be checked, of course. But some things might be harder to check, and sometimes things might be too subtle to even bother checking. What I hope is that this situation doesn't get more complex than it already is, and I can keep it under control :)

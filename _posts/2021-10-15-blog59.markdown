Selling!

I was thinking the other day that probably the most useful skill in life is "selling". You are selling something with every interaction in your life. When you want to meet someone, you are trying to sell them the value of meeting you. When you try to get hired, you are trying to sell your background/personality to the hiring team. I was thinking it would be awesome if we can master the art of selling throughout our lives. Some people might think that "selling" is associated by "lying"; But it doesn't have to be. You can tell the truth, but in a way that sells!

Sell my friends :)

Refactoring,

Today we spent some time on the MapReduce project, and I realized something (I knew it, but it was kind of like an affirmation):
I don't care about most of the criteria on `Good` of `Bad` code. I just write code, and my ability to write unorganized code and maintain it for
  a long time is amazing. It's not anything to brag about, but I can easily take a code that I've written ages ago and change something in it,
  even though most of them are not good written codes.
So I'm struggling with this idea. Because if you look that it from a team's perspective, eventually they are people who would have to
  read my code, or even work with it, and even if I can manage my own code, I should write a code that they can use as well. 
The problem is, that I'm absolutely fine with the way I write code, so I don't have any specific criteria on how to improve my coding.
Maybe a good place to start is actually reading some books on clean code or refactoring and stuff like that.

I also took a look at the `Gleam` programming language, it seemed ok but some parts that I'm mostly concerned about are still early in the development,
  so I would give it some more time before going deeper.

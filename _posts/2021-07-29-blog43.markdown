`Without Any Applications`:)

Should we aim to have a schedule, where everything we do is `useful`?
I used to think that way, but recently I've been thinking about `what is useful anyway?`. I'm not sure really :)) Maybe we should look at it from another perspective ... maybe it doesn't really matter what is useful and what is not useful. I think it boils down to this:
Do what you got to do :) and you're the one who has to define the meaning of that sentence :))

Willingness to look stupid,

We look stupid whenever we start doing something new, when looked at by an expert. Sometimes, this feeling of being stupid stops us from doing new things altogether! Even worse, it can stop us from exploring our curiosity. I personally have been like that for a good portion of my life! I don't remember exactly when, but somewhere along the line I stopped caring about it. It became obvious, that if I want to be great at anything, I first have to look stupid; it's a given, so I should deal with it! Like many other realities in life, it hurts at the beginning, but then it makes you free.

And let me remind you something about looking stupid: Those who matter don't care. And those who care don't matter.

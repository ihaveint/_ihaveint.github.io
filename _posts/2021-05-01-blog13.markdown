Ruined :))

I noticed that my implementation of MapReduce uses a more general abstraction than the original map reduce, I even wrote this in the proposal by mistake.
But now that I'm thinking about it, I don't konw whether I should keep it that way or not (basically the original map function in MapReduce takes a key and produce a key value, but in 
my current implementation, it can produce anything, as long as the reduce can handle it :)) )

Other than that, things are pretty good, I have deadlines coming up, so I should devote more time to theory for upcoming weeks.

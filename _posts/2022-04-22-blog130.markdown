Never again,

I have had problems with 'deadlines' my whole life. But it's going to change :) As Seth Godin says, I'm going to avoid getting near deadlines. It seems like such a hard thing to do, but I think the anxiety, and having to deal with it my whole life is even worse. So here is the plan: I'm going to do my best, but never cross the deadline, no matter how incomplete the task is. There might be other chances later on to complete a work that you could not before, but I'm not going to ask for it. There are always things to do, and I don't want to be held by things that I had to do but wasn't able to.

So I guess the lesson is to go on with our lives, with the new things that we are supposed to do, and not be held back by the old things. Everything has a time and a place, and we should never forget to let go of things when their time is over.

Another No,

Hello. It's interesting that today's writing has a similar vibe to the last one :)

First of all, here's a quick update on life:
I'm preparing for the summer :) I have a front-end internship coming up in next week. I'm also researching some topics related to envy free resource allocation, and also the usual things in formal verification.
I will also have a university course this summer. Besides all that, I'm trying to prepare for English proficiency exams.

And finally, here's the vibe that I was talking about at the beginning:

I had to say no to another thing :))
There's a lot going on. There are a lot of things I would love to do, and I'm trying to kind of seize the opportunities as fast as I can. But in this process, sometimes I realize that I'm trying to do more than I can handle, and I either have to admit it and take a step back, or try to convince myself otherwise and fail more miserably later. Fortunately, I chose the former this time.

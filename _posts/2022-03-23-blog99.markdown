Too much information,

The age of the internet is great in many ways, but also horrible in other ways. At this point in history, we almost always use the internet, either directly or indirectly, to learn things. But the thing about the internet is that you can't say what is true and what's not. That's on you to figure out! And it's unbelievably hard! There are some areas where there is not a unique truth, and multiple viewpoints can be true at the same time, but there are other areas that don't work like that.

There is no moral to this story! It's just something that I've been thinking about and something that probably all of us need to think about more.

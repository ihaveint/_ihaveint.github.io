Old memories,

I was talking to someone who I hadn't seen for a couple of years. Looking back on old memories was something out of this world, as it always is for me! I'm always amazed to see how much has changed, yet how little everything has changed. It seems like a contradiction, but makes total sense at the same time.

Talking about old memories, it seems that I keep dreaming about the past these days; I don't like it :) I prefer to think about the past voluntarily, not by force. And also, I would much rather my sleep be like an abyss; total darkness till I finally wake up. It's like I can't rest when I'm having dreams :)

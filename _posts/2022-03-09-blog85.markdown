Saying no,

Saying no can be difficult, but I've been thinking about something even more difficult: quitting something that you were once committed to doing. It is hard enough when it's something personal that only affects you, but it becomes so much more difficult when it's something that needs to be addressed with other people too. It can be ending a relationship, quitting a project, and sometimes things that affect people's lives tremendously, like firing half your employees because of whatever reason.

The thing in common with all of these is that sometimes you know you need to do something, even though it's not pleasurable to do so. But at the end of the day, the longer you hold off doing so, the greater the pain/regret is going to be in the future. So, as easy as it might sound, do whatever you need to do before it's too late :)

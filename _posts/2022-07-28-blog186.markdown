People that I don't even remember,

I spend the whole day alone today. For some reason, I was thinking about the conversations that I had with people when I was younger. I'm talking about something along the lines of 6 years ago. It's weird to see how clearly I remember those conversations! And also, reflecting back, it's interesting to see how much I have stayed the same, even though I have changed a lot (how It seems like a contradiction, but it's not). I have stayed the same, in the sense that a lot of my values are the same and I still think the same way. But I have changed in the way that I approach my values, and how I chase them!

Of course, there are a lot of other things that have changed, that I don't even remember :) But today, I was mostly thinking about those section of my value system that hasn't changed a bit.

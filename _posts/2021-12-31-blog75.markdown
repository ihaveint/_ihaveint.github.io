Not much,

I've been thinking about something lately: It seems to me that the most fundamental thing we need to change, in order to get different results in life, is out mindset. Sometimes, this change can be so hard that the actions that come after it pale in comparison. I don't mean that you don't need to take action, I just mean that more action with the same mindset is not going to get us ground-breaking results. You might get some `improvements`. But not ground-breaking ones! And the thing is, if we want to see improvements anyway, why not aim for the ground-breaking ones? :) Of course, most of the time, such results can only be achieved in the long term, but I think it's worth it if we are patient enough!

With that being said, we are a couple of hours away from the start of 2022. We don't celebrate Christmas in my country, but being able to talk to other people who are back from the holiday seems nice! But in an interesting way, I took a break in the same timeline, and now I'm back :)

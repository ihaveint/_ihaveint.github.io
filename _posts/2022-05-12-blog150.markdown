Lost in between,

Sometimes when I'm deeply struggling to solve something, I find myself, ironically, unable to remember what I was trying to do, to begin with! I think the same thing happens to all of us in life sometimes.

Something that might help with this is having friends that work on totally unrelated things to you: Talking to them would make you step out of your narrow world, even for a second, and then you might realize a lot of things about your work that you would not be able to otherwise :) Another thing is for yourself to have some things that you do outside your normal work, that you devote a good portion of your time to. Dealing with something completely different from your normal activities can give you so much inspiration and sometimes useful ideas in your line of work.

They say it doesn't matter how many times you fall, but how many times you stand up after falling, but is that true? I think you shouldn't focus on getting up when you fail at something, instead you shoul focus on the causes the made you fall in the first place, and try to prevent them from happening again, after you think about all of that and learn your mistakes, then it's okay to get up :)

The practice,

I guess the term "The practice" is something that always reminds me of Seth Godin. It's such a simple belief, but often we don't think like that, and this makes it even more interesting :)

Disclaimer: I'm just going to put it in terms of what I understand from it, I might be completely changing what Seth had in mind, and I'm not claiming that I'm saying what he says. This is just my interpretation! I think Seth even has a book on this, so you might want to read that if you want :)

The idea behind "the practice" is simple: Instead of worrying about how you want to be something (let's call it 'X' at the moment) and worrying about things that you might need to be a good 'X' and things you might need to avoid to not ruin it, just do what an 'X' does :) So, here is an example where I replace 'X' with 'a Runner':

If you want to be a runner, just start running for God's sake :) Instead of making it complicated more than it is, just run a little bit each day! After some point, like a month or two, you are a runner! You are not necessarily a world-level runner or anything near that, but no one can say that you're not a runner! And at that point, where you have already built the habits that make you a runner, you can improve your skills and make the momentum of being a runner only stronger.

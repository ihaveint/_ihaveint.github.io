Today I watched a TV show that recently got famous,
I HATED IT!

The thing is, a lot of times we spend our times on things just because other people told us to do so; And that's ludicrous! It might seem logical at first, but why in the world should you do something just because other people told you to? I can understand that if someone is like a role model to do and say something, you should at least give it a try, but I'm not talking about that here. I'm talking about scenarios that yo do something just because 10 random people talked about it. To talk more precisely, I think if doing something would take a lot of energy and/or time, you should not do it just because the society motivates you to do so; You should do it only if it is something that you connect with on a personal level.

"This is already painful :)"

Autopilot,

I think there is a difference between functioning on autopilot versus deliberately built habits (that you do every day without thinking).
To me, autopilot has a negative feeling, almost as if someone is so caught up in the mundane nature of life that he/she doesn't even make conscious decisions anymore.
By deliberately making habits, you save energy for what's more important; that's the difference! Both things are about habits, it's just that one is destructive, while the other is beneficial.

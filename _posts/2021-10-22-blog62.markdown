If anything, I'll be a writer!

I think I mentioned this before, but I feel like my job will incline towards being a writer over time! I might do it through different mediums in a sense: Even programming itself is kind of like writing, right? :))
And putting that aside, I think being able to articulate your thoughts through writing is priceless. To be honest, I haven't found anything remotely close to it yet!

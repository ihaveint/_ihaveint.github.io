Observability,

I think it's interesting to live your life in a way that can be observed by your future self. Of course, others can do it too, and that might cause you to feel insecure about sharing it. But if you can overcome this insecurity, you will be shocked when you look at your current life a few years down the road. It's like reading history, but where you are the main character, and that's so lovely, I think :)

Also, when someone you respect has done this process over the years, it's really interesting to go through their life and see the process they have gone through, and just how much they have changed over the years. So, if you have the confidence that someone might look up to you someday, think of this whole thing as giving them a priceless gift :)

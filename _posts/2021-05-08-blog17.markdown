On raft,

I'm thinking about reading the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) paper and implementing it.
raft is an attemp to make a consensus algorithm that is actually understandable :))

Also, a few days ago, I mentioned that I'm trying to implement an online judge backend. right now I'm trying to implement an infrastructure
for interactive checkers.

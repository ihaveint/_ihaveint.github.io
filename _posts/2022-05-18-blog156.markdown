Missed opportunities,

Sometimes when I look back, I think of opportunities that I could take advantage of, but just didn't! Some people regret their past when they find themselves in situations like this, and it's completely understandable! But I simply can't do it :) I actually used to do this when I was younger, but somehow, I realized that we, humans, will miss opportunities no matter what we do! Just the fact that you grabbed an opportunity at a certain time implies that you missed everything else that you could do at that moment! Another thing is that we can only see one 'lifetime', which is the life we have already lived so far. Everything else is an illusion. You might think that if you only grabbed that one opportunity five years ago, your life would have been better. How are you so sure about that? The tiniest changes in the past might have changed your present life in the most unimaginable way.

Arguments like these make me unable to regret the past. I realize that I have made a lot of mistakes, and I will probably make a lot of more mistakes on the way! All I can do is try more, and be a little bit better everyday. And I believe that's enough!

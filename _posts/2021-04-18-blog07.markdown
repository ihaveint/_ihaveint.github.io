This movie I watched,


I watched a movie (yesterday if I remember correctly).
it wasn't the best, but something that I really enjoyed was the fact
that the main characters treated life as if they were 
"grabbing life by the throat". It was nice.
at the end, one of the main character knew he was going to die, but 
before that, he smoked his last cigarete, seemed like he was enjoying
his last moments.

Luck,

I always force myself to work hard and not hope to get 'lucky' in stuff. It's not that  I believe that hard work is all there is to success: I know there are lots of other factors, including luck! But the thing is, I can't control luck; at least I don't know how to do it now! So, I tend to focus on what I can control. In the end, I might get lucky, or luck might even be my enemy! A few days ago, something happened to me that we can label as getting 'unlucky'. But today, I got lucky :) I love to have luck on my side; I might even learn somehow to be luckier over time! But for now, I don't like to call myself lucky, or unlucky. What I would love to do instead is to take every challenge that comes my way and try to win, regardless of whether luck is on my side or not :)

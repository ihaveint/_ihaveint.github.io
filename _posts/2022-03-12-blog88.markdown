Should we optimize everything, always?

TLDR: I think the answer is no!

Humans seem to be really into optimization these days :) But how far should we take this whole thing?
I think a lot of stress and anxiety caused in today's society is purely because we are trying to optimize everything; One thing that I can say for sure is that not everybody should, or even can, do that! Even if you can optimize everything, it doesn't mean you should! It seems to me that optimizing purely because you can is just ignoring the nature of being human. So, I think a good question before trying to optimize something, is to ask why? And ask a bunch of more why for every answer that you come up with, until you reach a real solid thing that doesn't need a why anymore and is trivial. If you fail to reach this trivial thing, simply don't optimize in the first place! If you do, good luck :)

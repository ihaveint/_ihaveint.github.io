Watch this unravel,

Right now is one of those moments in my life where I need to make a shift. I don't mean that I was doing something wrong and need to fix it; I just mean that I need to do somethings unique to this period of time. And I was thinking to my self, "No matter what I actually do, whether I do what I'm supposed to do or just flunk it out, life is going to move on. But whether I manage to do this `transitions`, on the long term, may determine a lot of things about my life. So I better stick to it and do it as best as I can!".

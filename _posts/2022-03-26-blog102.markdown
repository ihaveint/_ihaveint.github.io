Dreams,

Last night I had a couple of dreams, and for the first time, I was able to find the relation between them and what I was going through in real life. The only reason I was able to do this was because something unique happened to me recently, and as an effect, the dreams were different that what I usually experience. This got me thinking about possible things that I might do to be able to pull this of for my usual dreams as well.

Nothing in mind,

I try to write something everyday, which leads to failure every time :)
One of the reasons for this seems to be the fact that I don't even want to talk in real life! I mean, most of the things that people usually talk about seems useless. On the other hand, I kind of enjoy speaking, so we can say I'm at a crossroad! I can either not speak, because most things seem useless, or I can just say something, even though it might be useless. I don't know what to do yet, I'll have to think more :)

By the time I figure it out, here's a random story!

I was having a issue these couple of weeks. Let's address the whole thing as 'A'. Just to clear, I was aware of its existence, but I just was unable do to anything about it. A few days ago, I had a weird dream: I was literally following 'A', even though we had different destinations. A few moments passes by, and 'A' looked at me, and said "You know you should go, right?". We stopped there for a minute, talked about how this is going to be the last time we travel this path together, and eventually said goodbye.
After that, I woke up. How silly was that dream, I thought to myself. Now, it's been more than a week since this happened, and to my surprise, it seems that we really said goodbye :)

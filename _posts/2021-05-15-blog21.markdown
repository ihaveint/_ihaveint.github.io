Another panda day,

Yesterday I surpassed my ability of being a panda :))
Guess what I spent most of my time on? Yes! The MapReduce project.
I also published the current version on [hex](https://hex.pm/packages/map_reduce).
One interesting fact is that the number of lines in the code says nothing about the amount of things it does.
It used to be +200 hundred lines of code, and it had a lot of problems back then.
Now it has less then 100 hundred lines of code (well, unfortunately it still has a lot of problems).

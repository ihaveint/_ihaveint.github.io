I opened a file with vim, and it seemed my escape key was not working :)

well, I don't know what happened but after struggling a few minutes with different softwares and seeing that the escape key is not working at all, I restarted my computer with the hope that it gets fixed, and fortunately it did.

so that was random :) let's hop on to another random thing 

I noticed that there are a LOT of words that I write correctly when typing them by keyboard, but have absolutely no idea about their spelling :) I should also mention that I don't use any auto spelling tools.

These last few days have been both strange and awesome and also sad to some extent. I can't really explain it, but I can summarize the feelings:

- Bad things will happen
- Good things can happen
- Everything can happen
- Things will happen :)

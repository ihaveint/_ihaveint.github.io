Trying dumb things,

I always look for awesome things to do. There's nothing wrong with it, but the problem is that sometimes there is nothing awesome to do (at least nothing that I'm aware of). So what am I going to do in this scenario? My default is doing nothing: just waiting around for something great to enlighten me or something :)

Here is the question: Why not try something dumb if you don't have anything better to do? The weird thing about this is that we are not necessarily great at telling what is dumb before doing it. There might be something that looks stupid, but turns out great when you do it. And sometimes there is no way of figuring this out before actually doing it. Now, some stuff are beyond dumb! I'm talking about things that are harmful in some sense. I'm not saying that we should do those! All I'm saying, is that just because something doesn't look promising at first sight, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't even consider doing it! This is more true when you have nothing else to do! Just try something dumb :))

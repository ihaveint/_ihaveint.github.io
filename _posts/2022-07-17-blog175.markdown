How long has it been?

As I'm writing this, I'm in a cafe that seems really similar. I think I've been here years ago. As I'm sitting here, I have the same person by my side :) And that makes the nostalgia even more strong! The most amazing thing is that I'm at a totally different place in my life this time, and I'm extremely excited about this. The same goes for my friend, so I'm really excited for their journey as well :)

Overall, I've been thinking about the idea of going back to places that we went before, remembering how it used to feel, and also comparing it to how we feel right now. Remembering the events that took place during this timeline is always fascinating to me!

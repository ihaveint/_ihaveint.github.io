On being average,

I think it's a good idea to always put yourself into groups, where you are pretty much the average person in the group. What I didn't realize back then, was that this doesn't make you an average person :) You are just an average person when you are inside that group. On a more objective basis, you might be an outlier in the world. And this was so important for me. You see, I was reluctant to be the average person in a group because I didn't want to be an average person. I guess we all want that to some degree. And I avoided being somewhere where I would be counted as average. But now, I realize that just being average for a couple of hours when you are with a group of people, or even being dumb, can be to your advantage :)

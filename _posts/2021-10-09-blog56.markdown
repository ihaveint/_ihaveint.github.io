Long before it was fun,

Somebody told me today that having stress is the same as being anxious!
I don't agree with that AT ALL!
To me, stress is the best thing ever, I thrive in stressful situations. I can't breathe without stress :)) I don't feel alive without it.
But to be frank, it's not something to be proud of. It's just the way I am. I think the most important thing is to recognize how we function, and trying to maximize on that.

But I loved it long before that!

Too many days later,

In the past days days I was mostly thinking about things.
I was also trying to contact some people, it worked to some extents :))
I'm also considering taking a course this summer (for the first time), I contacted the lecturer and I'm waiting for a response, which would give me a basic idea whether I should do it or not.

I also heard the name "George Hotz" for the first time, his take on life (and specially on computer science and those kinds of things) is really interesting. It seems he has a Youtube challenge and after watching one of his videos, I think it's really interesting.

Logical Foundations,

As of yesterday, I'm reading the series on [software foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu), starting with Volume 1. The reason for this was that I came accross the concept of verification so many times and I had no clue about it, so I contemplated learning about it for some time. It's been amazing so far, I'm also trying to get to a point where I can understand some aspects of [the Prusti project](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/prusti.html).

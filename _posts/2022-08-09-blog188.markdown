What I've been up to,

For the last couple of days, I've been focusing on other social media platforms. For some reason, I've come to the conclusion that I've neglected the true power of social media for so long, and I need to make it up somehow :)) 

I've been meeting friends, old and new, and I'm really happy about that! I can hardly find a day in my calendar where I don't have a dinner scheduled with someone :) And that's both bad and good in its own unique ways :)

On the week days, I work every second of the day, except the time that I meet my friends, which is (almost) always after 5 PM. Anything before 5 PM is either a super important thing that comes up and I need to do it, or work. There are even times that I can't eat a proper lunch! But overall, I consider this new phase of my life as an orange juice that will probably come to an end someday; but I will try to extract every bit of juice out of it before it does :))

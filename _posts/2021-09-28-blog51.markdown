Start early!

Well, that's too much for me to say (crying about his reputation)!

But really, I'm trying to do things earlier; I used to postpone everything to the last possible minute; I still think there are benefits to that, but when done strategically, not because of laziness!

One thing that is particularly useful, is sending emails (or anything, really) early, but for a specific time in the future; This just gives me a feeling that I'm on top of things and every now and then, my mail server is sending emails to someone while I'm sleeping! Gives me a sense of productivity (and also respect to other's people timezone).

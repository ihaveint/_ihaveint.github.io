Seeing someone you knew a long time ago,

Today, I saw someone that I used to know a long time ago. I'm talking about something like 7-8 years ago. To be honest, I didn't even recognize them at first :) But they seemed to know me! We didn't get the chance to talk after that, so I had some alone time to think about this whole thing! 8 years is a long time, and I wondered what kind of a person this old friend remembers me to be! Of course, I have changed a lot over the years, but right now, it seems impossible to change the picture that they have about me on their mind, unless we can manage to literally get to know each other from the beginning! But that's life, I guess! I would love to take everyone through this journey of me, trying to improve myself and a lot of other things, but people just grow apart over the years, and I don't think I can do much about it.

Nevertheless, I hope whenever we think about these past friendships, all we remember is the good parts, and it brings back a smile!

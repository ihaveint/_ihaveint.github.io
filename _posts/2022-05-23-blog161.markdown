Memory distortion,

I was on the road today, for most of the day. So, nothing in particular happened. Weirdly, it feels like it didn't even happen :) But when I think about it, it becomes clear, again, that it certainly did happen.

I think the same thing happens to all of us. Our memories become distorted. Some small memories feel as if they were huge when they happened, and some big ones feel as though they were not even that important! When we look back on our lives, the same thing can happen! We might have achieved a lot, but might feel like we are failures. And for some people, weirdly, they feel so proud of themselves while they haven't done anything useful in their whole life :) I'm not in the position to judge people, but I think that it would benefit all of us if we can capture our life somehow, so that can judge our past more precisely when we are looking back on our lives :) This whole blog of mine happened for this exact reason!

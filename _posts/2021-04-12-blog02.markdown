Good! 

yesterday was not a good day :))
I missed a deadline, submitted another assignment with 26 minutes delay, 
  and also missed another event :(

so why did I start with "good"?

I think as bad as it went, I can learn what to improve so at least I can reduce the likelihood of 
similar situations happening again. Some of these issues are easy to fix, for example, for every 
event I can set a reminder, instead of trusting my memory :)

I also watched the [data wrangling](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/data-wrangling/) lecture from the missing semester, highly recommended.

just a random thing:

I used to write all my assignments using tex, but I reallized that as fast as I type,
  if I want to do assignments more efficiently, I either have to learn some advanced stuff,
  like [this](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/), or I have to look into other alternatives.
  I'v tried using google doc for 2 my assignments so far, and it turned out better than I expected.
  you can even use tex format for writing formulas, which is great!

A new series,

I'm thinking of doing something new. Here is a shallow picture:
I'm going to explore an existing project, one project every X day. (I have to figure out a good value for X)
in the end, I'm going to have a document (publicly shared), where I have written my thoughts on the project, and possible things to improve upon.
The goal for me is to choose projects in areas that I'm most interested in, to see what kind of things people have done in the past, and get inspiration for my own work.
Also, writing is something that I like, so writing about it and sharing it with others is another benefit.

That's it, I have yet to figure out how I'm going to publish these studies. One way is to add a section on top of this very website. Or I can just make a new dedicated website for this sake. We'll see.

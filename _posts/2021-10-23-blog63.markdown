"This is easy!"

Have you ever thought that, maybe, some of the things that we consider hard are actually the easiest things one can do? They just seem hard because you haven't been exposed to their essence yet! And ironically, the same argument holds for things that seem easy! Some of them are harder that one can imagine! The deeper you look at them, the deeper they look at you :)

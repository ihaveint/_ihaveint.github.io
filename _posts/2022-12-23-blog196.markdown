Today marks as the start of my third week in the U.S! It's been kind of like what I imagined for the most part, but of course somethings are not like what you expect them to be.

Other than that, I've been struggling with some personal decisions. Right now, I'm trying to take a step back and see what's feasible and what's not, and try to see what options I really have :)) It's not an ideal world where I have the options that I would like to have; I just have to play with the cards that I'm dealt with!

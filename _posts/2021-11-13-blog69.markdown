Confusion about what average means!

I always thought that I wasn't average. At least on the areas that I cared about. But these last couple of years, I've realized that I am in fact average, in almost every area. There 'might' be a couple of things that I have the potential to be great at, but even at those areas it is so hard to be at the top 1 percent, or something remotely close to that.

But here's the thing: If you don't want to be average, for whatever reason, it is so damn important to find something, that you can be good at. Not something you 'think' you can be good at. Something that you 'can' be good at, realistically. This is one of those tricky areas, because a lot of times we are encouraged to do whatever we want, to pursue what we love, I suppose. But that's not necessarily good advice! If all you want in life is enjoying what you do, then sure! Do what you love and don't think about anything else. But if that's not what is most important to you, why the hell should you do what you love? If you want to make money, putting aside if that's a good goal or not, what the hell should you do what you love instead of focusing on your goal, making money? If your goal is to be the best in your field, what should you choose a field that you have no chance of even being good at, let alone being the best?

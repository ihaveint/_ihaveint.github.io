At the end of the day, who is to blame?

There are numerous situations where you can argue that the messed up situation is not your fault, and a lot of times it is acceptable.
But I think it's a better approach to always take the blame. I don't mean to say it's our fault when it may not be, but we can ALWAYS take the blame.
Maybe `blame` is not a good word for it, feel free to substitute it with `responsiblity`.

I'm also thinking that these notes should not be names `blog`. I'm thinking for a better name.

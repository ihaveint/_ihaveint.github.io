I couldn't breathe,

The days are longer nowadays; it's almost as if every minute is an hour or something. But strangely, when a day comes to an end, it's almost as if it was so short that it couldn't even start. I'm not sure which of the two is more accurate; all I know is that it's hard to endure, not because I have to endure pain, but because I have no idea what is awaiting me at the other side. But that's exactly what makes it so exciting at the same time!

I didn't breathe.

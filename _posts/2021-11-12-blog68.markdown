I couldn't breathe,

The days are longer nowadays, it's almost as if every minute is an hour or something. But on the other hand, when a day comes to an end, it's almost as if it was so short that it didn't even have the time to start. I'm not sure which of these two is more accurate; all I know is that it's hard, not because I have to endure a pain, but because I know what is awaiting me at the other side.

I didn't breathe.

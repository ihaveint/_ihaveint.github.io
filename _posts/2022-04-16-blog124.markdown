What do you want to see?


It's amazing that when you take two people, they don't see the same thing when they are staring at the same subject. It's not about what the subject is on an objective level, but rather about what they want to see in it, and that's so important. But here is an interesting thing: When two people meet for the first time, they give an initial impression of how they want to be seen. This impression is going to last for a very long time, if not forever. So I think it's important to not take the first impression for granted. Always think about what you want to convey when you first meet someone and have a plan for doing it. I don't think you should trick people, at least I don't recommend it. But you can always show what you want to show in a better way without tricking people :))

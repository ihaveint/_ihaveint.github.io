Yesterday I spent most of my time on some combinatorial optimization problems,
we also improved some parts of the MapReduce project (to use key-value implementation instead of the more generalized implementation that we used before).

I feel like I'm improving in writing elixir code, so that's good news :)) 

Today I worked more on the mapreduce project, and now I'm either going to work on another project or read some books.


Random fact:
I saw a language called `Gleam` a few days ago, I want to check that out :))

If songs had a taste,

I'm the kind of person who really enjoys music. Not every type of music, of course. But there are some that play with my soul :) And I'm not exaggerating! Sometimes I try to come up with the closest thing comparable to it, but I have never come even close to it. Actually, I enjoy it so much that if I had the chance to re-live my life with one talent of my choice, if would be talent in music. Some people really don't believe in that kind of talent, but I do :) It's not that you can't get good at things by practicing, but I'm not talking about good here. I'm talking about being exceptionally good at it, and I think it requires talent to some extent.

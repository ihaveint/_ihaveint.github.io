More of this,

I'm the kind of person who is literally miserable if I have less than a certain amount of problems in life. Of course, I'm not talking about problems that can't be solved. I'm talking about problems that can presumably be challenged and solved. This threshold works astonishingly for me: starting from no problems, I get more miserable the more problems I have, UNTIL I reach this threshold. After that, I get so damn excited about crushing these problems :) Crushing is a light word here; I might fail in the short term, but that only makes me more excited :)

Right now, I'm at this threshold. The last time I was here was about five years ago. I remember those days just like it was yesterday. And I can only imagine what's going to happen next! I'm beyond excited; like a hunter that has found its prey after waiting for years :)

And to an old friend who I lost long ago, I will say: this is what we've been waiting for, for so long!

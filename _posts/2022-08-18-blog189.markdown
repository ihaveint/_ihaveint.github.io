Words,

Lately, I've been paying attention to the words that we use in our conversations. I think that no matter how much we try, we can't really convey what we are thinking about perfectly. So, our best shot, then, would be to learn better words, and how to use them :) It's not something that people would usually do, but I'm constantly paying attention to every f*cking word that comes out of my mouth (and others, for what it's worth). Then, I look at the other person's eye, and if they seem confused, or I think that they misunderstood what I said, I will go back and try to say what I said in another way. It always works in the end, although it requires much more effort :)

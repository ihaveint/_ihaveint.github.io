I need to learn how to 'really' code,

I've had this feeling for a couple of years now, that I can't actually code :)
To put it into more context, I feel like real 'coding' should be treated as art, not just writing something the runs or compiles without any error.
And at this point, the code that I write does not feel like art whatsoever! So, I think I need to put some effort into the basics and boring stuff :)

I had a dream,

Yesterday, I was watching a video; and it literally felt like this guy was directly talking to me.
It was so bad, apparently, that I had a conversation about the subject with him in my dream :)
But one thing that was really interesting to me, was how 'good' he talked. By good, I mean in a way that I have never seen before!
So to the point, unique, and honest (or maybe even some characteristics that I'm not aware of).

Forgetting about my dreams, today is the first of November; which means that the deadlines for the graduate schools that I'm applying to start as early as 1 month from now.
That's both good and bad! I'm happy that it's all coming to an end and I'm going to see the result soon. But I'm also stressed to some extent (you know, fear of getting rejected from everywhere and not knowing what to do next). Nonetheless, I have decided to finish strong, and just do the best I can, regardless of what happens next.

I've been thinking about this idea for a couple of days now, that I might delete every public thing I have on social media and start from scratch.
It's not that I am ashamed of what I've done in the past and now I don't want anyone to be exposed to the old me. I used to think that's the reason why people get rid of stuff, and it never made sense to me. I always thought: "Well, you should be proud of how much you grew at least, and it should be inspiring to other people too ... So why delete it?"
But now, I'm going through this for a different reason, which I don't want to share ;) At least for now.

For starters, I want to pick a theme for this blogs, and I should do my absolute best to stick to them. I will give myself about a month to experiment a bit and change this narrative if I want to!
And just for letting you know, if you follow me on other platforms: the same thing is going to happen everywhere. So bear with me for a while.

And if you happened to be someone who enjoyed this spontaneous things and don't happen to like the new direction, all I can say is I'm happy that you liked what I had to say or/and show for a while. I just can't help but do what needs to be done ;)

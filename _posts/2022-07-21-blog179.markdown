Wrong metrics,

I remember a few months ago when I set a goal for myself: 'By the end of July, I want to get this many nu numbers of **important** emails (whatever important was at the time)'. Now, we are coming to the end of July, and I actually saw that I am reaching the goal that I set for myself. I can't really share the idea behind what was 'important' at the time, but I can say this: the whole thing was so dumb :) Whatever I wanted to do, I could take the more direct approach. And you know, we don't always need metrics for everything! I'm dealing with enough metrics in my day to day basis, and I've had enough of it :)) I don't need to add extra metrics to my personal life, especially when I can take a better approach.

So, this was a short reminder, to myself, and to others who might need it at some point: Just the fact that you can set a metric for something doesn't mean that you should actually do it. Think twice :)

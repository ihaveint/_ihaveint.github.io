Overcommitting,

I've personally done this so many times! The story is always the same: there are so many things that I get excited about, and I try to tackle all of them at the same time, without realizing that I can't possibly do all of them without either losing sleep or my mind! In the end, I have to drop some of them by force, but it's never a pleasant experience, as you can imagine. As a way to mitigate this problem, my new way of doing things is not doing them! I try to commit to a minimal set of tasks at a time, and only add a task if I'm confident that I can do it and I have plenty of extra time in the day. If not, I'm just going to put it on a to-do list and see if I can get to it later. If I can't, I just let it go :)

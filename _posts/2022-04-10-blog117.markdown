Judging yourself,

Sometimes I try to make a non-perfect plan slightly better. And just by trying,  I manage to ruin the whole thing! My intent was never to ruin it! I wanted to make it better. And I should add that it wasn't necessarily because I did something stupid! Here's an analogy that I like to use: it's like playing Jenga with an opponent and removing two pieces instead of one when you get excited. Of course, getting excited here might make you lose, where you could win if you just removed the one piece that was expected of you! Looking back on such occasions, it's easy to judge yourself and think that you should never get excited, that you should always stick with the rules and remove one piece at a time, and do only what is expected of you. Please don't judge yourself that way :) Sometimes it's better to remove two pieces, and sometimes it's not. It would be ideal if you knew this ahead of time! But sometimes it's close to impossible and is out of your control. So just try to play the game and avoid making stupid decisions as much as you can, but don't judge yourself :))

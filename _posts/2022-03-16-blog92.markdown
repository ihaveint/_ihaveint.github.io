Being amateur,

(I'm not sure if I have written about this before, I hope not!)
Sometimes we want to do something new, and with everything you start, there is a reality you have to accept: You such at it when you begin. I have a thesis about this: as we grow older, it becomes increasingly harder to do new things, especially if we are regarded as experts in some field. The ego doesn't want us to start all over again and accept that we suck at something, it just wants to do what we're good at, and that's pretty much it. And to be clear, I'm not the type of guy who thinks you should do everything just for the sake of "doing something new". I'm talking about when you strategically decide to do something because you believe it will benefit you in some way (could range anywhere from your future career to just pure joy). So, I guess the advice here is that you should try to keep your ego under control and don't let it ruin everything :)

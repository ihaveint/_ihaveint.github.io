Accept the loss,

We all lose some battles in life. The ones that hurt the most are often those that we thought we were going to win. The thought that you should win a battle can lead you to deny the loss to the point that could magnify the loss to an even greater loss. This was happening to me today. I wanted to win something, and the plan was going well. Sometimes some minor obstacles show up, and I tried to somehow resolve them. At some point, there were so many obstacles that I should have just accepted the truth: I'm not going to win this, at least not now! But I was so focused on winning that I didn't accept it. Fortunately, I was able to finally accept the loss at a point, but I have to say: I got lucky. I could have taken a bad hit, a hit that could have been detrimental. I just got lucky! I know I lost, but I feel grateful that I was able to retreat before it was too late.

This blog is to remind us that there are two kinds of battles in life: One where you can take the loss fully, no matter how bad it is, and one where the loss is so bad in and of itself that you should minimize the damage if you are going to lose. You can take risks in the first kind of battle, but don't let your ego make you do the same for the second kind of battle. You might regret it later :)

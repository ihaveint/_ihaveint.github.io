Sometimes it's too late,

We've all heard that "It's never too late". I don't agree: I think sometimes IT IS TOO LATE! And it's important for us to accept it when the time comes.

We, humans, always want to believe in this fallacy for a variety of reasons. One that comes to mind is that we want to fix things. We don't want to leave them broken. And we also want to correct our mistakes. There's nothing wrong with these goals, but the problem is that we can't fix everything in our limited life time as humans. It's essential to choose what you want to improve, but it might be even more important to choose what NOT to improve, simply because you don't have that much time :)

When you continue this line of thought, it becomes evident that sometimes it's too late. It's like standing in the middle of what used to be your house, except that it's burnt by fire, and now you are standing on the ashes. It's long gone :) And the sooner you accept that, the sooner you can deal with the pain and move on with your life.

With all that being said, the challenge to decide: "When is it too late?"

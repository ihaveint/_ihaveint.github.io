We all have heard of this thing that you should always do nice things, even when no one is watching ...

I think the whole idea is good :) You should, sometimes, do things just for the sake of doing them, without wanting to be seen. That's when you appreciate the thing itself instead of whatever other say about you doing it.
And you know, sometimes I do this kind of things. It is joyful in and of itself, and I never really expected any kind of reward for it :)) 
But today, for the first time in my life, someone returned the kindness :)) It was the exact same thing, although for what seemed a different reason; I don't honestly care about that :)) What seems strange, is that this has NEVER happened to me, even though it's not a crazy thing :))
And you know, I'm happy about this. I don't believe in karma as people do, but I have my own kind of reasoning why this might be happening; and that actually makes me excited :)) I might talk about that later!

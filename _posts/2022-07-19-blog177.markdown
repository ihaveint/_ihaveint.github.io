A hard day,

Today was one of those days that I just did what I have to do, but it was so hard that it almost felt like a bad dream.
I joined a handful of other people, where we are part of a quantitative analysis boot camp, learning the basics of this art :) I really like the idea and the execution behind it, but it's hard, to be honest :) I've had a couple of similar experiences before, but I always forget how hard it is to start a new thing. And you know, I'm the kind of person who jumps into things, before really testing the water. So, I feel as if the concepts are sometimes more new/challenging to me when comparing myself to the other students. But of course, I could be wrong :) I think I shouldn't even judge myself on such things. What matters in the end, is coming stronger at the end of it, with more knowledge, and have found a couple of friends alongside :)


(Edit: Little did I know, tomorrow was going to get even harder)

On switching,

I've been wanting to learn Japanese for a couple of years now. Back in the day, I used to watch a lot of animes, so my motivation was to be able to understand them without the subtitles. Fast-forward to today, I don't watch anime anymore! What I do watch, is lots of Korean shows :))

As a result of this change, I'm more familiar with the Korean language these days. Nevertheless, whenever I wanted to resume my language learning journey, I would go back to Japanese, even though it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I knew in the back of my head that learning Korean would be much more enjoyable because of the current situation I'm in, but I wasn't able to change the course. Finally, a couple of days ago, I made the decision to go with Korean for now.

This is a stupid story in many ways. But there is a big lesson in it for me: There are times when we commit to something and spend a lot of time on it. However, for whatever reason, we might find ourselves interested in something else after a while, but we refuse to change the course because we think that it means that we wasted a lot of time on the previous subject. Hence, we just do what we used to do, just for the sake of it. It's important to also take into account what we want to do, even if it actually means that we wasted a bunch of our time before it.

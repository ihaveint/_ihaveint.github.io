Old memories,

I was listening to some songs, and I was reminded of the old days :) It's amazing to think about the number of stupid things that I used to do. And I can't believe how much I enjoy thinking about the old times :) I don't sit and think to myself "Wow, I could use those times to do something more useful"; instead I say "Wow, I really enjoyed the time I had. It was so amazing" with a big smile on my face. Not everyone might have the luxury to do this, as they might have done something that turned out to be detrimental to their life, so I'm careful not to take this big smile for granted :)

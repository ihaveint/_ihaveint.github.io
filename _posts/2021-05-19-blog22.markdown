The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way - `Marcus Aurelius`

That, my friend, was another random thing :)) let's move on to todays blog :))

It seems that the series on the elixir homepage on getting started with elixir is really a great one to get you familiar with elixir.
   I haven't read it completely, so I'm thinking about doing that.

I'm starting to force myself to do things a little bit more efficient. For example, the idea of turning my homeworks 1 day before the deadline 
is something that rarely happens, so I'm trying to incline toward doing that king of stuff.

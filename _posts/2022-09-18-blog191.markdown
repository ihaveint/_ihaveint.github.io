Today is the first day of what would have been my 9 semester of college, except that it isn't!
Somewhere along the line, I decided to get my degree as soon as possible. A lot happened along the way that could have persuaded a person to undo that decision, but I stuck with it. As with every other decision in life, I'm not sure if it was the best decision or not, but I could say that I'm proud of it. And I guess that's all that matters, for now :))

Things have been hectic lately, and I'm kind of addicted to it now :)) It's like, whenever things start of slow down, I add a bunch to it to make the pace fast again! There are different reasons for doing this, but I'm also curious to see how much I can keep this up!

Start again,

I decided to start from the beginning. This applies to a couple of things, which I don't want to get into right now. The topic of this blog is exploring the rationale for doing so! Sometimes we find ourselves doing something for so long, and yet not getting the result we want out of it. You might feel like a photographer who feels disgusted by his own photographs. What do we do in these situations? I don't think there is only one way to get out of this rut, but one way that I'm going to pursue, for now, is to forget everything you know about photography and start again. Of course, this would be extremely difficult to do, but I think it's a journey I'm willing to start.

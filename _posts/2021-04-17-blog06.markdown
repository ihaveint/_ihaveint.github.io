Perfect window placement,

today I'm joining a study group session on reinforcement learning,
  looking forward to it.

I'm also thinking about "responsibility", more specificly, 
  about the idea that we're not only responsible about what we do,
  but also responsible for things other people do. I don't mean 
  that if somebody makes a mistake, it's my fault. but if I ignore it,
  it's also my fault to some extent.
but the problem is this: what happens to freedom of choice ? and who decides
what is wrong and what is right?

so that's what's on my mind :)) I haven't reached any conclusion yet.

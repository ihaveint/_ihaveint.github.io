Conflicts,

Today was challenging in the sense that I had to resolve a lot of conflicts at the same time. My whole schedule was divided into two parallel possible schedules, and I needed to do something! I think the main lesson was that you need to choose! It doesn't need to be the optimal choice, and you will probably never make the best choice with anything in your life! But you need to make a choice! This is mainly because your responsibilities will only get more serious as you go through life, and if you can't even make the decisions you need to now, with the simple things that are given to you now, you will probably be in deep shit tomorrow :))

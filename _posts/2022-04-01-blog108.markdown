Do you hear what you're saying?

I think it helps a lot if we listen to our plans :)
Talking to ourselves, going through the plan one step at a time. Sometimes you'll be shocked at how dumb you sound when you are listening to yourself, or how much you can improve things by simply listening carefully. Of course, you can kind of do the same by talking to other people, but listening to yourself allows you to first think critically about the plan without being affected by other people's opinions, which you can always do later :)

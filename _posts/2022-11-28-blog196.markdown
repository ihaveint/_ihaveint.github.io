First, let's be clear what definition of act I'm using here: "take action; do something".

I've been thinking about something lately: That we can achieve a lot by being better actors. I'm talking about acting so good that even yourself forget it's an act. It becomes real after a while, and is no longer an act; it just is :)

I used to think it's bad to 'act', that it's kind of 'evil'. I think the intention behind the act is what's important. If you are acting to manipulate, then of course it's bad. But if you are acting because you want to make something become real, then be it :)

A month ago, on October 28th, I was acting. And I think I did a good job :)) I've been acting in that role ever since; but I think it's time to change the role now ;)

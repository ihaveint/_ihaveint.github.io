Lovely conversations,

last night, I got an invitation to talk to someone :) It was weird at first! I've been wanting to talk to them for the last two years, but now they were asking if they could talk to me, and now! :) Of course, I was surprised, but I grabbed the chance anyway. It turned out that word of mouth has unusually connected us, and they wanted to talk to me about the past, in a way that we never could before! And that's exactly why I call this conversation 'lovely'. An effort to talk about the past is not always lovely, but an effort to talk about the past, in a way that can also help your future endeavors is lovely to me.

But there was also another reason I call this conversation lovely: I was talking to someone who was a friend to me years ago. Even though we have talked on other platforms, and in other ways, this was our first online conversation, using audio. Of course, it was lovely :)

But deep in my heart, the most important reason has to be the fact that they weren't doing this out of responsibility, but because they simply wanted to help me in a new phase in my life. And let me assure you, our conversation surely helped me with that!

If you end up reading this till the end, thank you for the conversation; I mean it ;)

Sorry that I can't reveal the identity of this person right now :) At least, I haven't asked for their permission yet :)

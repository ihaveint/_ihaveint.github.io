Resourcefulness,

It's amazing how the world is just different based on what you surround yourself with, and also things like the people you know, etc. At first glance, we all have access to all the information in the world for free (internet), but having the possibility to access something doesn't mean that you can access it! The larger the pool, the harder it is to find the thing you want, UNLESS you have the necessary means to find it. And for better or worse, a lot of times the people you have access to determine whether you can do the thing you want or not.

I think what I am talking about is called 'resourcefulness' as a whole. And I think it is extremely important to become more resourceful as we grow older!

Don't try to relive the past,

For the past couple of days, I found myself trying desperately to relive some of the experiences that I had in the past. The takeaway was that I should never do it again! When you have a memory of something, usually the memory itself is so deeper than the actual thing. You have lived with this memory for years, and might have even changed it for some reasons. When you try to relive whatever that memory holds, you will probably get disappointed. It's just not as you remember it to be!

I'm not saying that you should avoid experiencing things that you remember from the past. But what I'm saying is that you can't 'relive' the past. You can only remember it to some approximation, and that's all you can get. Don't get greedy, and don't look for more. You have the present now, and you will probably miss it too in the future! So hold on to what you have right now, not what you used to have :)

Unfair games,

It's easy to feel like a victim in life. A lot of things happen that could be called unfair. The belief that life is not good 'because' things are unfair is extremely tricky to avoid. I often find myself getting into this trap so often! when you give in to the idea that things are unfair, you let go of the tiny amount of control that you had to begin with. Now you have no control :) It's both a curse and a blessing :)

So, I think that even though life is unfair on so many occasions, submitting to it is not going to help. Even it is unfair, the important thing is how we're going to play the cards that we have been dealt!

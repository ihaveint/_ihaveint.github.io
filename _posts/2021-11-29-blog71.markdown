So mad,

I'm starting to think that most of the things that people do is so weird! To put it simply, how they 'orient' their lives is so weird; and I don't mean in a good way :) But what interests me about this phenomenon is how they get here, and whether I'm the same or not. I really don't know; but it seems that searching within ourselves instead of just filling our time with things ,to forget about the core issues, is the best thing to do in the long term!

I wonder just how much of our problems can be solved by 'better design'?

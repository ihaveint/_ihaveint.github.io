I'm thinking a story told by Ryan Serhant, about when one of his clients reach back to him after about 10(?) years, saying that she have been a little busy :)) But a crucial part of the story is how Ryan emailed a listing to her every week, during all those years, without giving up! It's crazy :))


But I'm sure there are thousands of scenarios, just like this, that never had a happy ending :) So it's hard to say that Ryan did the right thing. But his mindset is precious regardless of the result.


---------------
That's it :) I'm not sure if I have any conclusion for it. It's just that I hope I don't give up on things; at least as long as it's better not to!

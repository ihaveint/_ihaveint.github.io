Balance,

We have a definition of balance and how it should be. I'm talking about the balance between things we do in life. One weird definition that I like the most, is being unstable and focusing on one thing at a time, but balancing it out by switching to another thing when needed. This is something that makes way more sense to me than trying to keep everything in the air somehow. You might have a better balance over time, as you try to avoid chaotic situations and have more long-term plans. But inevitably, sometimes you find yourself in the depth of chaos, and it's OK to get out of there by not having balance :) What I'm saying, is that not having the balance at times might get you your desired balance in the future!

Very important message (Saying goodbye!)

All the contents are this blog is going to get deleted immediately! (Of course, it's me, Soroush, talking here! So, don't worry! No one has hacked anything on my computer or something!!)

For reasons that I can't explain yet, everything is going to get deleted here! All the history and all the past blogs are still accessible through my Github, so don't think that something big has happened and I'm hiding something!! You can read everything, from the moment I started writing this blog, which was at least a year ago, to the last blog that I wrote just a few days ago! So, don't worry, nothing bad is going to happen! Everything is fine!! Just know that I don't recommend reading the blogs! Even though they are accessible to the public, they will always be!! (As long as I can host them somewhere, of course! Even if it means paying out my own pocket!)

The last (updated note): Even though I'm giving up on this blog, for now, I have not given up on writing (not yet at least). You can always find my writings in other places too, with the very same name (Soroush Zare). But even if you don't, you can easily drop me a message (which, again, you can find on this very website - at the bottom of the page). That's it for now :)) I'll upload this file as long as I need to. But, there is no new blog coming up :))

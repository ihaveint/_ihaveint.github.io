choron :))

Today marks another end, and another beginning.
It's been quite a time since I have written anything on this blog; It's been kind of hectic, I guess.
I've been practically been alone for like a month now, and it's really strange! Sometimes, you just feel you're going to lose your mind. In contrast, there are times that you are so happy that you can just do whatever you want and nobody would tell you anything :))


Just a bit of clarification:
When I say `alone`, I mean that I don't see people, like none :)) On average I have not gone out of the house even once a week.

Apart from that, yesterday I just picker the courses that I'll have for the following semester. I'm looking forward to see how it would go.

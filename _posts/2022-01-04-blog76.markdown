Is there such a thing as good addiction?

I was thinking that some things might be worth getting addicted to.
Like, it could be different for everybody. So I'm not saying that there is a thing, called X, such that its objectively good for every person to get addicted to. But I'm saying that there are, probably, subjective things for each person that are worth getting addicted to. And to be precise, here is the definition of addiction that I have in mind:
`the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance, thing, or activity`

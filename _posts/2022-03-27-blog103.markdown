Alone,

I think being alone is powerful. There might be different ways to interpret 'alone'. What I mean is to be by yourself, and not thinking about anything in particular! Just letting your thoughts flow as they like, without trying to ignore anything, or without trying to think about anything in particular. It's just like watching yourself. This process can help you realize you much about yourself, and sometimes things that you would have avoided by being 'busy'. You might understand things about yourself that are not pretty, but are a part of you. And understanding yourself allows you to make on step toward being a better version of yourself, one day at a time!

Doing something with anger,

A lot of times when I talk to people and friends, it feels like we are conditioned to see anger and rage as something negative. I think anger can be extremely useful if you use it right. There are things that you can's possibly do without being angry :) Now, being angry doesn't mean that you submit to it and smash things on your way. What I'm saying is that if you use the energy within the anger right, there are so many good things you can do with it :)

So, the next time you find yourself angry, use it to your advantage!

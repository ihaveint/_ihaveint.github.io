I'm a sentimental person when it comes to sounds! I might hear something that brings up memories, and the sound itself might make me emotional. A lot of the times, this happens when I listen to a song that I haven't in a while. It can also happens with the voice of people that I haven't spoken to for a long time (and it's different than missing someone, I don't know what to call it). In a sense, this is getting more stronger as I get older, but also more sad. There are some people that I'm not even sure I can recognize if I were to see them; but I'm sure I'm going to cry as soon as I hear them talk. And the idea is that they might have changed so much during the years that I can't even remember who they are, but sound is going to find its way :)

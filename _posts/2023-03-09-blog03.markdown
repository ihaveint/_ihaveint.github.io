This is about how I went somewhere a few days ago, that I wasn't supposed to be at :) And how weirdly enough, it turned out to be a good choice ..

So, I went somewhere, an event of some source. And you know, soon enough, it became kind of evident that I wouldn't have gone there if I actually knew more about it (I don't really want to get specific, because they were cool about it).

But the one thing that I didn't see coming, was that these people were really passionate about this whole thing they were doing :) I had a bunch of experience in it already, but I tried to mostly observe and see how they were going about it. And I could say, even though I think I could do a better job at approaching the whole thing, I don't think I would be as passionate about it. And that was one of those light bulb moments, where I thought that a lot of times, a bit of passion can go a long way. I don't mean that it's not necessary to get good at what you're trying to do; I think you should strive for that as well. But I think, without passion, it's just not fun. And weirdly enough, when you are passionate about it, people are more welcoming towards the fact that you are still not good enough!

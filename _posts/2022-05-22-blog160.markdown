Talking to strangers,

There was a time when I always talked to strangers. I liked talking to them more than I liked talking to friends. It was like stepping into an unknown world and just wandering. I'm not sure why, but I stopped doing it over time! Now that I think about it, one of the reasons might have been that I got too distracted by listening to what others had to say, instead of listening to myself. But now, after two years of stepping away from talking to strangers, I started doing it again. At first, it was because I missed it! After a while, I realized that I should switch back and forth between these two phases: Sometimes, I need to completely focus on myself, and sometimes I should listen to what others have to say. I don't know why I never thought about this, even though it seems so simple :)

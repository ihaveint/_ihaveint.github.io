You're a professional writer now!

During this period of applying for grad school, it is occurring to me that writing is so important, at least in the academia world.
Look, the most important things I'm going to do in this remaining couple of months is just writing! Writing a bunch of `statement of something` :))
And sometimes I wonder if that's a good use of energy; I know writing is important, but guess what else is important ... Time :))

Nevertheless, I wrote my first version of SOP today, I have written several earlier versions before, but I would not even call them a draft, they were just thoughts.
I'm probably going to share it with some people and also change it through a couple of iterations. And since there are others things that I have to write, like personal statement, I'm going to start writing those as well.


Happy writing, I guess :))

There is a book series that I wanted to read for years ... 


The reason I didn't read them was something along the line that it took a lot of time to read them and I didn't have time, that kind of thing :)) I'm starting to feel that It's time to read them (maybe it's too late, even). Lately I feel like some of the things that I spend time on actually don't matter at all, and somethings that I don't spend time on, actually are really important. So, I'm trying to change that, even just a little.

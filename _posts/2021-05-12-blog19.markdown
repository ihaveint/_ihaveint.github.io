Matroids,

at this point of my combinatorial optimization course, the topic is on matroids.
It is a difficult subject, but at the same time it is quite amazing. I think I should spend more time on that.

I'm also trying to wrap up the [Elixir coding-gnome](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers) course.
I think Dave does an amazing job, it's a really enjoyable process.

The last couple of months,

Hello yall :))
I'm excited to start another chapter, where I share my thoughts!

The last couple of weeks (or months, you could say) have been absolutely crazy! When I say 'crazy', I mean crazy! I went on the verge of being crazy, and again, I mean literally! It was so bad at some point that I thought I would never come back to this side of life :)

But you know, I don't want to talk about that story right now. Not because I can't, or I don't want to; but because I want to explain it in more detail sometime when I have the time for it!

But now that we are over that phase, what I'm going to do instead, is share what I have learned through this process, and how I have changed. That would be my main goal for this new series of blogs. But of course, I might change my opinion later on!

This is wild!

a few days ago I saw [another awesome livestreem](https://t.co/DPQSekOKiO?amp=1) from Jon.
I took the time today and walked through it, and I can't explain how excieted I was while coding along. I'm not even going to try! maybe tomorrow :))

A quick note to what's happening:
in this livestream Jon talks about a paper he saw on simulating lock free algorithms in a wait free manner, and starts to implement it in Rust. [Here's](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~edwardduong/PDF_files_of_relevant_papers/2014%20-%20Practical%20wait-freedom.pdf) the original paper.

We only have a limited amount of energy, in any given day.

Well, I guess you already knew that!
But the thing is, we often don't realize that this amount is REAAALLLY limited! And we just do whatever we want with it.
I think we should try to me more intentional about what we spend our energy on.

An strategy that have been helping me with this, is keeping things simple. Like, instead of searching for productivity apps, I just use google calendar go block some times and that's pretty much it. I know that using more advanced methods can be more useful in the long run, but right now I just need to get started; I don't need to overwhelm myself with complicated tools.

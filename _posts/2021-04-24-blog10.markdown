could do a whole lot better :)

Today I had combinatorial optimization midterm, I messed up some easy problems :))

I also fixed some issues with the proposal on our team project for distributed systems course, so the final draft(is that a thing?)
  is available [here](https://github.com/ihaveint/map_reduce/blob/main/proposal.pdf)

I'm also reading [Erlang in Anger](https://www.erlang-in-anger.com), more on it later :))

`Almost` ruined it.

Since the pandemic started, this is the first time that I'm actually spending some time alone. This will probably go on for about a month, which I hope would be a good experience.

Yesterday I had a TOEFL mock exam. It wasn't bad, but I hope I can improve my skills in remaining time I have until the actual test.
There are some other things going on, I came across an interesting research topic. But the problem with that, is the fact that `A lot of things are interesting these days`, So I'm thinking about how to tackle it.

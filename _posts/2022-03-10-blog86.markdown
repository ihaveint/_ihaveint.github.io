I love computers, as long as ...

I've been thinking about something: I seem to really like computers, at least the things that we can do with them make me excited. But imagining a scenario where I'm the only person on the planet, there's no way I would still be excited about computers and things I can do with them. The reason has come clear over time: computers are a tool made by humans to help them in doing their activities more efficiently, and if there is nobody else besides me on the planet, much of what I would do to survive (assuming that I would like to survive), doesn't need to be efficient anymore, and the whole joy of using computers would get ruined for me.

But it's interesting that there are things that I think I would still enjoy doing in this scenario: I would love to read books, assuming that they have not vanished as well. I would also love to write books, even though I know there is no one to read them! This seems weird at first: why should I still enjoy such activities? The more I think about it, there is only one conclusion that I can come to: I like doing these things because it's the closest thing that resembles human interaction. Even though I know there is no one else on the planet, reading a book still feels like a dialogue between me and the author, and writing a book seems like teaching a subject or sharing my viewpoint with other people.

Writing more,

I'm trying to write more aggressively, and not only here on this blog!
Besides this blog, I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to organize my own thoughts and also document important things, and I'm also writing notes on paper to organize my thoughts (It's literally a medium for thinking while also writing at the same time). And the interesting thing is that the more I'm writing, the more I can write! And also the more everything becomes clear! It's really interesting :)
I'm also trying the screen time in mac which allows you to limit your application usages. I'm currently trying to limit the usage of Telegram. I'm also using another app called to limit the usage of Youtube (I think it might be possible to do it with screen time as well, I should check that later)

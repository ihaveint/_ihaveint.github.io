Do you need to do this?

I have a lot of things that I would 'like' to do. I guess I can say that I would get lost in the exciting feeling of doing so many things, that I forget to ask myself an important question: "Do I need to do this?". I mean, is the thing that I'm trying to do necessary? Can it be avoided nicely by doing something easier, perhaps? What are the benefits of doing this? Questions like this often lead to the conclusion that you shouldn't do the thing :) And don't get me wrong, the purpose of this process is not to be a lazy person who doesn't do anything! The purpose is to have more free time to do more important things, and sometimes things that give you the most joy.

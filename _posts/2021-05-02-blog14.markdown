Ideas,

Yesterday I bought [Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/sgdpelixir/concurrent-data-processing-in-elixir/)
I'm planning to learn more elixir and perhaps use some of these ideas in the [MapReduce](https://github.com/ihaveint/map_reduce) project,

I'm also exploring possible new projects, so far I'm mainly considering projects that are distributed in nature or 
have something to do with concurrency. 

I could also do a simple blockchain like network, still thinking about that :)

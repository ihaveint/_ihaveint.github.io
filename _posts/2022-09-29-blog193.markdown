I think I need to make some notes on the previous blog, just to prevent future misunderstandings :)

When I say that these events make make feel more 'responsible' for my own life, it doesn't mean that I think it's my (or anyone else, for what it's worse) fault that this is happening. I'm talking on the macro level here: I mean that even though there are lots of things that are happening right now, and might happen again in the future, I don't think that I should let these events dictate my life (at least, I should prevent it as much as I can). Of course, a lot of factors might be out of my control, but I still might be able to play around with the few ones that are in my control. And surprisingly, that's enough more often than not!

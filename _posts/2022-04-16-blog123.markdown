Should you tie your identity to something that you do?

Well, I think it depends :)
I know people in each of these two categories, where some of them are miserable and some of them are fulfilled in life.

I think the answer lies in what you want out of life, not the objectivity of whether each of these two approaches is correct or not.

For me, this question is almost analogous to another question: "Do you want other people to like you for who you are, or do you want to be liked for what you do (for people)?". I know a lot of people who prefer to be liked for "who they are". But for me, it has to be what I do. I don't even think there remains anything of me if I detach the things I do. Like, what are you going to like if I don't do anything for you? :)) And I'm not talking about doing special things for people. Even the simple act of being kind to someone is something you do for them.

So, in conclusion, I think there's nothing inherently bad/good with attaching your identity to things you do. But you should be careful about why and who you do it. It's all in the little details of how and why you do things :)

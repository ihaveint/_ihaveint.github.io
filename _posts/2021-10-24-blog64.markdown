"Right next to my doorstep",

Today was a happy kind of day: I just had an idea for something, and it went really well!
Of course, all of it was at the expense of delaying some other stuff I wanted to do.
But apart from being a happy day, I just realized how some of the stuff I've been planning for so long are are actually starting to pay off, which is really interesting! I always knew that this was bound to happen, but not to this extent! And right, all I keep asking myself is, "Imagine if I plan something bigger for the next time!".

"Yes, I can hear you!"

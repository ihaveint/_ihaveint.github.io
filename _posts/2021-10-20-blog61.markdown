"What would you do if you knew you were going to fail anyway?" - Seth

I've had this dilemma for a good chunk of my life; Should I try to 'change' my behavior, or at least how I convey myself to others, in order to increase my chance of success? The thing is, even though we actually 'change' ourselves over time, by trying to be something that we are not 'yet', it seems illogical to actively do this just for the sake of being 'liked' in some way. When we actively do this, even if somebody likes it, that's simply not us. And in some ways, we don't actually want people to like something that is not us, we want people to like the thing that we actually are. It's absolutely fine to change over time, to improve in whatever aspect of life that is important to us. But trying to 'act' like something that we aren't, is a whole different game that I think we should avoid at all costs.


Well,  we ARE going to fail anyway, at least in some sense!

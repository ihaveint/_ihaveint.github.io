What can I do for you?

Let's say you could do anything you wanted in life: You could have anything, do anything, and go everywhere you ever wanted. The only condition is that whenever you go, the first thing people see when you enter the room, is a letter you will write now. You can't change this letter down the road; you write it now, but it will be with you for the rest of your life. The question is: What will you write?

It's interesting that a lot of people will write something about themselves. For me, the only thing that I can think of is something along the lines of "How can I help you?". It's not that I think I can be useful to everyone: It's just that if I can help even a small group of people by saying that, I think it's worth it to carry such a thing with myself for the rest of my life.

Being sick,

Today, I found out that I might have COVID. At first, I was worried that I might not be able to do my usual routing during the next couple of days. I was even worried about [long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html)!

But then going through the day, I realized that my habits are going to save me: Even though I feel seek through every cell of my bone, my muscles do the things they always do. It's like they don't even care. I feel the sickness, but it doesn't matter :)) Of course, it might be a crappy road ahead for the next couple of days, but that's it! I'm not going to ruin my next couple of days, just because I have COVID :)

And this is extremely weird! I don't think I could be this positive about this if I caught COVID a couple of months ago. But now, I have a support system around me that makes me feel supported, regardless of whether I actually have COVID or not!

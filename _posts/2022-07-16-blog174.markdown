After a long time,

It's been about 2 years (maybe a bit more) since I've been watching Korean movies instead of western movies. I won't be getting into the details, but the important thing is that I've been enjoying them! Lately, I didn't have the time to enjoy them anymore, so it was on my list to get back to watching them as soon as possible! And in the last 2 days, I was finally able to do that! I liked the feeling, almost as if I was seeing a lost friend after a long time. But of course, no relationship can go back in time: I don't think I'll ever be able to watch movies like I used to. There are tons of responsibilities that I have taken on, and even when I have a few days off, I prefer to read books or walk with a friend or something, instead of just watching movies.

The lesson in all of this, for me, is that no matter how much you enjoy something, the joy itself is going to change. You are not going to enjoy it like that forever! Even if you do, you might not be able to enjoy it, because you have other things to do. Long story short, enjoy things while they last :)

listening :)

I'm trying to listen a little bit more (that is, to anything), so everything is kind of `quite` :)
Apart from that, I'm trying to come up with a realistic project for the functional programming sessions.

I'm also experimenting with [livebook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook), and a tool called [markdown-slides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides), which lets you create slides shows based on your markdown files, I think that's amazing :)

Watching movies,


When you watch movies for a long time, it's easy to associate the things you see from a character with their real personality: You feel as if that person is really like that in real life. But time passes, you see them in another movie, and you would not believe how much different they are in that new movie. We, humans, are not necessarily like that to this extent. But I feel like we are like that to some degree. We can be different when we are in different situations, and that's a good thing. I don't think we should put too much emphasis on 'how' we are. Because that can all change in the slip of a moment because the new situation calls for it. That's exactly why I don't believe in personality tests. Like, what are we trying to test? Do you really believe that you are either an emotional person or a logical person? Really? Well, I don't :) There's no problem with calling yourself an 'emotional' person, but not to the extent that can't even bring yourself to be logical. The reverse also holds.

In short, don't put yourself into boxes by force. There are enough boxes already :)

Looking for something similar,


We, humans, are built to look for similar things. This is mostly because of the revolutionary benefits that it brings to us. But in the current state of the world, sometimes we should force ourselves to not look for similar things, especially when we are unhappy about some aspect of our lives. It would be extremely challenging to do so because we are literally built for this. The least we can do is remind ourselves before committing to something new that we are looking for something unfamiliar (at least on some level).

I would have never left if I was looking for something similar.

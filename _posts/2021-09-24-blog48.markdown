The last day,

I've been practically living alone in the past 1 and a half month, which was a unique experience, especially during COVID. Today I'm finally going back to my parent's house for a while.
I'm also trying to read more, as a whole. There are a couple of fields that I'm mostly considering for graduate school, like programming languages and distributed (or systems in general), so I thought it would be a good idea to read more about these topics. Right now I'm trying to read more about programming languages, and also compilers.

The other day, I saw [this thread](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1438972527838117895) on twitter. It was interesting, so I thought I could share it here.

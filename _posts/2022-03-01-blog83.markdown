Not ready for this,

Right now, we are in a crazy time in history; I don't really feel like to blog like I usually do, I'm not feeling good about writing normal things in a time like this! But as time went by, I'm feeling like 'writing' is a journey in and of itself for me, and I don't want to make it dependent on how I feel or whether I feel like writing or not! Therefore, starting today, I'm going to start writing as usual, and probably more than ever! With that being said, let's go back to our reguarly scheduled program!

I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-IUY6QrJyU) yesterday. It was a really interesting watch, especially since the last version of the code is exactly how I would have written it (except, so much uglier, which I'm not proud of). I think the take away is this code from SICP: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"

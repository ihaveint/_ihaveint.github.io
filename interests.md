`Interest` is a vague word, I'm interested about a lot of things. I try to categorize them into some
meaningful subjects:

- Academia
	- Programming Languages
	- Distributed Systems
	

-  Programming Languages:
	- Rust
	- Elixir


- Editor(s)
	- Vim
	- I'm exploring Doom Emacs, it seems cool
	- Vim :))

- Books
	- The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck
	- [Designing Elixir Systems with OTP](https://pragprog.com/titles/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp/)
	- [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good](https://learnyousomeerlang.com)
	- TODO

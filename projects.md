First of all, some notes about what this page is, and what it's not!

- I'm not going to list every project that I have worked on (or working on). I'm mostly going to say what I'm thinking about/working on. For a full list, you can always check my [github](https://github.com/ihaveint) or other sources.
- 'project' can be anything that has been on my mind for more than a month. It doesn't have to lead to anything useful, but it always have the possibility to! It's not necessarily going to be related to academia, or even related to computers.

So now that we are clear about what this page is, here's what I've been thinking about:
- I'm thinking about writing a 'meta' compiler in Elixir, that allows programmers (with working knowledge of Elixir) to build new programming languages of their own. The way they do that is by simply defining the syntax of their new language, and mapping the semantics of the new syntax to how an identical code would run in Elixir. They are probably a bunch of things that can be added to this to make it more enjoyable, but for now I'm mostly thinking about how the user interface would like.

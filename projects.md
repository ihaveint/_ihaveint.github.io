Here are some projects I'm working on:
- fault-tolerant [MapReduce implementation](https://github.com/ihaveint/map_reduce)
- Rust implementation of [Wait-Free Simulation for Lock-Free Data Structures](http://cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/Papers/wf-simulation-full.pdf), with help from [Jon's](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset/featured) streams
